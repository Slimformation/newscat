From Alison Harding, CNN
updated 1:44 AM EDT, Wed May 22, 2013
(CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner is running for New York City mayor, he announced Wednesday morning in a video posted on his campaign website .
"Look, I've made some big mistakes and I know I've let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons," Weiner said in the video. "I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it for my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."
Weiner plotting a political comeback?
Now that Weiner is in the race, the Democrat will undoubtedly face questions from voters and fellow candidates about the 2011 scandal that eventually led to his resignation from Congress.
His political career was derailed after he was found sending lewd photos and messages to multiple women. At first he lied, claiming his Twitter was hacked, but he later admitted to the indiscretions and left the House of Representatives.

UNION, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — It’s a controversial proposal: Paying for every mile you drive to cover road repairs.
While some say it’s necessary, others are saying it’s time to put the brakes on the idea, CBS 2’s Christine Sloan reported Tuesday.
It’s the one thing New Jersey can boast about – having the fourth-lowest gas tax in the nation . The money goes into the state’s transportation trust fund, paying for roads and bridges.
But what if you learned the fund is $14.3 billion in debt, and the gas tax just covers a yearly $991 million debt payment?
“The problem there is because previous administrations and legislatures raided the transportation trust fund to use that money in general funds,” said Sal Risalvato of the New Jersey Gasoline Convenience Automotive Association .
It’s what prompted the bill to repeal the gas tax and have residents pay for every mile they drive, so cars that don’t use gasoline or get better mileage pay for roads, too.
“How are you going to track that?” one driver wondered.
It turns out, with a GPS device. The concern was about big brother watching, so after opposition, the sponsor of the legislation this week amended the bill to only tax electric and compressed natural gas-powered car owners with a yearly $50 fee.
“They’re using the same roads everyone else is so they should pay the same tax,” said Susan Berowitz of Mountainside.
“Why should they be penalized for helping the environment?” added Danielle Morse of Union.
The Sierra Club agrees, with director Jeff Tittel saying, “We try to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars but now this is a disincentive.”
He said raise the gas tax. But with federal incentives to make fuel-efficient cars, Risalvato said there could be a mileage tax.
“Someday this could be the means,” Risalvato said.
Risalvato said some insurance companies are using mileage tracking devices and car manufacturers could build them into cars.
The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Jim Whelan told CBS 2 that while he is for fuel-efficient cars, $50 isn’t much money when you can afford to buy a car that cost more than $40,000. Hybrid cars are exempt in his bill. Two other states have vehicle mileage tax laws, Washington and Virginia.

CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson said on Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been "compromised" for over two years.
Attkisson told a local Philadelphia radio station that she has been working with investigators to discover the source of the activity.
"There has been an issue in my house and there has been an issue with my computers that's gone on for quite a long time that we're looking into," she said.
Attkisson has long been a thorn in the side of the White House, and a hero to conservatives, for her aggressive reporting on the incident in Benghazi and on the "Fast and Furious" controversy.
In 2011, she made waves when she claimed that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting on "Fast and Furious."
Host Chris Stigall asked if Attkisson thought that she had been the victim of a government operation, as the Associated Press and Fox News' James Rosen were . Attkisson was careful not to make any specific allegations about who had been targeting her, but she said it was possible there was a connection.
"I think there could be some relationship between these types of things and what happened to me," she said, adding that something suspicious had been happening since "at least February of 2011 and I think probably a significant period of time before that."
UPDATE: A spokesperson for CBS News told HuffPost's Michael Calderone, "We are investigating the matter."

We produce enough of oil not to have to import it from other places. If you look at the cost of gas in top oil producing countries in the world they﻿ only pay a small fraction for oil compared to us. Of course we consume a lot more than then they do but the reason we pay so much more is because a large portion of oil that we produce is exported to other countries. Does that make any sense to you? OIl companies take American oil, sell it to other countries for big profit and then charge us more.

10 Amazing Charts That Demonstrate The Slow, Agonizing Death Of The American Worker
By Michael, on May 16th, 2013
The middle class American worker is in danger of becoming an endangered species.  The politicians are not telling you the truth, and the mainstream media is certainly not telling you the truth, but the reality is that there is nothing but bad news on the horizon for workers in the United States.  In the old days, when the big corporations that dominate our society did well, that also meant good things for American workers since those corporations would need more of us to work for them.  But in the emerging one world economic system that our economy is being merged into, those corporations have other choices now.  For instance, the big corporations can now choose to limit the number of "expensive" American workers that they employ by shipping millions of jobs to the other side of the world .  And from their perspective, it makes perfect sense.  They can make much bigger profits by hiring people on the other side of the planet to work for them for less than a dollar an hour.  If they can get good production out of those people, then why should they hire Americans for ten to twenty times as much, plus have to give those Americans health insurance and other benefits?  Another major factor in the slow, agonizing death of the American worker is technology.  We live during a period when technology is advancing at a pace that is almost unimaginable at the same time that it is steadily becoming cheaper and cheaper.  That means that it is going to become easier and easier for companies to replace workers with robots and computers.  As I have written about previously , it is being projected that our economy will lose millions of jobs to technology in the coming years.  Yes, some of us will still be needed to help build the robots and the computers, but not all of us will.  And of course the overall general weakness of the economy is not helping matters either.  The American people inherited the greatest economic machine in the history of the world, and we have wrecked it.  Decades of very foolish decisions have resulted in the period of steady economic decline that we are experiencing now.
America is simply not the economic powerhouse that it once was.  Back in 2001, the U.S. economy accounted for 31.8 percent of global GDP.  By 2011, the U.S. economy only accounted for 21.6 percent of global GDP.  That is a collapse any way that you want to look at it.
Today, American workers are living in an economy that is rapidly declining, and their jobs are steadily being stolen by robots, computers and foreign workers that live in countries where it is legal to pay slave labor wages.  Politicians from both political parties refuse to do anything to stop the bleeding because they think that the status quo is working just great.
So don't expect things to get better any time soon.
The following are 10 amazing charts that demonstrate the slow, agonizing death of the American worker...
#1 Wages And Salaries As A Percentage Of GDP
As you can see, wages as a percentage of GDP are hovering near an all-time record low.  That means that American workers are bringing home a smaller share of the economic pie than ever before.
#2 Average Annual Hours Worked Per Employed Person In The United States
We are an economy that is rapidly trading good paying full-time jobs for low paying part-time jobs.  The decline in average annual hours worked that we have witnessed represents the equivalent of losing millions of jobs.  There has been an explosion of " the working poor " in the United States, and this trend is probably only going to accelerate in the years to come.
#3 Manufacturing Employment
As you can see, there are less Americans working in manufacturing today than there was in 1950 even though the population of the country has more than doubled since then.  The United States has lost more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities since 2001, and yet our politicians stand around and do nothing about it.
#4 Employment-Population Ratio
This is one of my favorite charts.  It shows that there has been absolutely no employment recovery at all since the end of the last recession.  The percentage of working age Americans that have a job has stayed under 59 percent for 44 months in a row.  How much worse will things get when the next major economic downturn strikes?
#5 Labor Force Participation Rate
This is how the Obama administration is getting the "unemployment rate" to magically go down.  They are pretending that millions upon millions of Americans simply do not want to work anymore.  As you will notice, the decline of the labor force participation rate has accelerated greatly since Barack Obama entered the White House.
#6 Duration Of Unemployment
The average amount of time that it takes an unemployed worker to find a new job has declined slightly, but it is still far above normal historical levels.  It is a crying shame that it takes the average unemployed worker two-thirds of a year to find a new job, but this is the new economic reality that we are all living in.
#7 Delinquency Rate On Residential Mortgages
Since there are not enough jobs for all of us, and since our wages are not rising as rapidly as the cost of living is, a whole bunch of us are falling behind on our mortgages.  As you can see, the mortgage delinquency rate has only dropped slightly and is still way, way above typical levels.
#8 New Homes Sold
American workers also don't have enough money to go out and buy new homes either.  Yes, new home sales have rebounded slightly this year, but we are nowhere near where we used to be.
#9 Consumer Credit
Millions of American families continue to resort to going into debt in a desperate attempt to make ends meet.  After a slight interruption during the last recession, consumer credit once again is growing at a frightening pace.
#10 Self-Employment At A Record Low
Since there aren't enough jobs for everyone, why aren't more Americans trying to start their own businesses?  Well, the reality of the matter is that the government has made it exceedingly difficult to start your own business today.  Taxes, rules, regulations and red tape are choking the life out of millions of small businesses in the United States.  As a result, the percentage of self-employed Americans is at a record low .
As all of these long-term trends continue, the middle class will continue to shrink, poverty in America will continue to explode and government dependence will continue to rise.
The numbers don't lie.  Today, the number of Americans on Social Security Disability now exceeds the entire population of Greece , and the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the entire population of Spain .
We are in the midst of a horrifying economic collapse, and the next major wave of that collapse is rapidly approaching.
Are you ready?

You’d probably be too weak from starvation to escape. Just kidding. I don’t know if it will get to the point where we’re taken to internment camps. I certainly hope it doesn’t get that bad. But it has happened in past. There is a book that everyone should read. It’s called “The Real Lincoln: A Second Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda and an Unnecessary War” by Tom DiLorenzo. Lincoln actually had political opponents imprisoned. The book was a real eye-opener for me in that what I was taught in the public school system was mostly fiction.

Two more good books to read: “The Naked Capitalist,” by W. Cleon Skousen. (130 pages, a short commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley’s book  (1300 pages)”Tragedy and Hope. A History of The World In Our Time.”
The second book: “Fahrenheit 451″ by Ray Bradbury, another very short book.
Your mama
This is your main problem I think: way too much fiction
dancingontheheadofapin
I don’t have a problem, “Your Mama.” If you know how to read, I would advise you to get your head out of the sand and read not only the books I listed, but also George Orwell’s “1984″ and “Behold A Pale Horse” by William Cooper.  Cooper was murdered for exposing the government by writing and publishing this book.  Do a search for William Cooper or go to You Tube to see some of his videos.  The two books I listed in my previous comment are short books, so for those with a short attention span they will be fine.  If you want to really understand what is going on read the two in this comment.  Orwell’s book was thought of as fiction when it was written because no one believed it could happen.  Do  yourself a favor and get educated.

All information from the Government and all information from the

dancingontheheadofapin
Read not the written word of mankind??  What about the Bible??  If we do not know history, we are doomed to repeat it.  Before written history was oral history, which was handed down from generation to generation. Some of the books of the Bible were written many years after Christ left this earth.  Those histories were passed down.  How would anyone know about anything beyond their own sphere of existence of the nation and the world unless there was communication?  Observation is subjective as is most communication.  Learn from it and then make decisions based on common sense.

All it takes is for OPEC to dump the dollar for something else(petro-dollars) and its Game Over. China could trigger that very easily and simply: just plain stop buying our debt. This would cause inflation to more than likely start rising at an uncontrolled rate(not quite Hyper, but close), which would cause OPEC to start looking at something else, and then our problems would multiply as the rest of the world would then start buying oil with some other form of currency and the dollars start flying back home. I actually hope this happens, the sooner the better, as  it would usher in a real recovery sooner instead of this miserable existence that we live in now….
Midwesterner
I mostly agree with you except China has already stopped buying our debt, that is why the FED stepped in to buy it, no one else wants it. As far as consequences of OPEC exiting from the US Petro Dollar, absolutely correct but Iraq and Libya tried that and we know what happened to them. Iran sells its oil for gold, not Dollars, which puts them on the radar too. As long as the most powerful military in the world is backing the Petro Dollar, they will be able to keep the game going.
MeMadMax
Incorrect, china is still buying debt, they have to unless/until the yen gets a good foothold. The segment that has stopped buying our debt is the personal type, as in individuals/small groups and the like. Although you would be correct in saying the Fed is buying the bulk of the debt however. And the opec deal all falls on saudi arabia, I think they will  pull the trigger after they get a nuke. They are actively shopping for one(and not hiding it), along with Bahrain.
Your mama
Really? You don’t think the bush gang has given their boyfriends in S.A. a few nukes by now?
MeMadMax
Nope. They would advertise the fact directly to Iran by now.
MeMadMax
Ugg, I mean Saudi Arabia will pull the plug on the dollar once they get their hands on a nuke AND a stronger currency takes hold. In that case, a nuke would be an insurance policy for doing whatever they want without worries of attack either from Iran the US or anyone.
http://www.facebook.com/gilbert.furguson Gilbert Furguson
they have several nukes thats why they did not receive scud missile attacks during gulf two
MeMadMax
mmm, no. Saddam lost most of his scuds during the first gulf war. There were hunter killer parties of Apache helicopters that destroyed most of them, hundreds of them… When gulf war 2 happened, patriot missile was on the scene and reliable, you also had the 5th fleet stationed 24/7/365…

Also, everyone would know that the Saudi’s have nukes, particularly Iran.

The facts are there no doubt. The charts are well done. Now how do you get 80% of the American public, to pull their heads out of the sand to read them. Also for those who agreed during the Cyruss crisis. That part of the game was the Russians wanted use of Cypress facilities for its’ new Mediterranean fleet. The first Russian task force docked in Cypress today. First time since USSR collapsed, that elements of the Russian pacific fleet have entered the Med.
Felicia
Contradiction. The increased number of women in the workforce quadrupled from the Rush Limbaugh era of the 1950s. A majority of middle class women are making more money than ever before in history, more women are in top position jobs and more women are enrolling in college.
The visible minorities are the marginalised groups, but affirmative action will increase the job prospects for the visible minorities in America.
Syrin
You’re kidding right?   You know WHY more women are in the work force?   Look at that graph showing wages.    They HAVE to be.   Affirmative Action is why we have the worst president in history occupying the WHite House.    Affirmative Action forces employers to hire unqualified people at above market salaries, and they can’t fire them because minorities are no longer protected classes, they are privileged.
Angela
That is racist. Diversity is our strength. Diversity is good. FYI, if it wasn’t for affirmative action, I would have been neglected for hiring. Because I am a girl, I face discrimination in the patriarchal society. Did you know that a woman earns 45% less than an average white man working the same job?
Syrin
Diversity is not good.   Multi-culturalism has proven to be a failed experiment leading to violence.
Read and learn.   Stop blaming men for your problems: “Generally, women value relationships more than their careers or money, enter and leave the work force at a much higher rate, work part-time at a much higher rate, and work in professions with much lower compensation. As he explains in his book,Why Men Earn More, nearly all of it boils down to differences in occupation, and men overwhelmingly dominate jobs that
are in an unpleasant environment (sanitation vs. child care)
require harder-to-attain skills (physics vs. philosophy)
require longer work hours
demand financial risk (entrepreneur vs. teaching)
are inconvenient (i.e., relocation)
are hazardous (construction vs. librarian)
Due to the simple laws of supply and demand, these occupations pay more and contribute immensely to the pay gap. But again, government statistics completely neglect occupation — making a raw comparison of all working men and women instead (e.g., the female receptionist is lumped in with the $21,000/hr Lebron James and little-guy Michael Moore).
Wage gap statistics also do not account for time commitment. On average, women work far less than men because they choose to have much more balance in their lives. A study by the Center for Policy Alternatives and Lifetime Television found that nearly 85 percent of women took advantage of flexible work arrangements offered by their employers. And a decade after graduating college, 39 percent of women leave the work force or work part-time, versus 3 percent of men. Aside from the obvious benefits of working longer, workers who average 44 or more hours per week earn approximately 100 percent more than workers who average 40 hours.”

Here’s an example of discrimination against a woman brought to you by the PC affirmative action police in Philadelphia. A trilingual college-educated Hispanic/Uruguayan woman I know applied for a job with the city, which was enthusiastic when they saw her Spanish name but quickly lost their enthusiasm when they saw  that she was a WHITE Hispanic woman. The idiot affirmative action Democraps couldn’t wrap their racist heads around the fact that a woman could be both white and Hispanic. She didn’t fit their narrow view of what a Hispanic woman is supposed to look like. So much for “diversity.”
Conclusion: some of the worst bigots are government Democraps who support affirmative action quotas.
https://www.facebook.com/beth.s.owens1?ref=tn_tnmn Beth
45%? Perhaps in some instances but not as a whole. Refresh your research. And you only face discrimination in a patriarchal society because you believe you do. Get rid of that chip on your shoulder; believe in yourself and remember the wise words of Eleanor Rossevelt–”No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”.

wow…where did all these new people come from? Felicia, Tracy, you sound like you had just plagiarized a Sociology textbook. I think you are missing the whole point of this article (as well as the stats) in that our jobs and productivity have been shipped offshore and we are simply living on a falsely inflated economy and borrowed time. “Affirmative Action” is just so much more politically correct mumbo jumbo that actually punishes companies and employers rather than helping the marginalized in attaining opportunity. The problem with so many ideas set forth by….well, idealists–is that they SOUND all good but in all reality we DON’T live in a Utopian world; MLK’s dream is great for inspiration but the reality of such dreams will always fall short.
Tracy, you post about the future of our next generations being in the hands of todays girls (loose quote, sorry) is a scary and sobering thought. So many young people are caught up in what I call the “Matrix”, an unreal technological world unattached from down to Earth reality; a narcissistic generation that cannot live without constant input, affirmation, attention, etc. from their peers. So many  young people have NO real life skills WHATSOEVER. How IS this next generation going to function? Are they going to go to college, get a government job (pretty soon it looks like all jobs are going to be government jobs) pay other people to cook, clean, and raise their children? Already happening. I am almost 50 years old, I’ve seen a lot and the world change so very much in my life; but I can assure you the best thing you can give to your children/the next generation is STABILITY. Not a $400 phone, not the best day care ever, not the best labels out there, but the stability, love and encouragement of parents/caretakers that are totally committed to the upbringing of their young.

I’m not exactly a feminist, but I’m not patriarchal either. No particular bias,  my POV comes from real life and observation. Stats are just horrible for children raised in fatherless homes.
When our kids were young, we chose to live SIMPLY in order to give to them stability.

The mental, spiritual and emotional health of future generations is directly related to the amount of time, care and input they enjoy from wise women who understand that a woman does not need to compete with a man and raising a family is the highest art.
Equal does not mean same. We are not the same, but we are equal in terms of honour we deserve for doing that which is our main purpose and mission.
A full time mother is a physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, healer, artist, spiritual leader, etc, etc..
Opportunities for further learning and sharing abound in a women’s realm.
What happens to the children who are being raised by the internet, TV and their peers?
Are we better off after this drive for women to prove their equality by competing in the realm of career?
Men need to honor and respect our realm and both men and women need to come together and learn (or re-learn) how to have peace in our homes.
Craig
Good point Roseof13…..The economy is going down, jobs are being lost by the tens of thousands and the only solution given from these radical feminists is they should get jobs :-/ Radical feminists are a bunch of whining, entitled and spoiled women who can’t find a decent man and when the thugs and dunces wear out their bodies, the feminists spew hatred all over the place like the stuff squirted on their face in the rave parties.

Craig: Tom Leykis has had a lot to say about the type of bitches you describe. When they’re still attractive, they waste their youth on every type of loser, reprobate and scumbag they can get their hands on (or as you put it, “thugs and dunces”). But when their youth and looks gone are gone and they are 50 or 60 pounds overweight (all that boozing, binge eating and cigarette smoking takes it toll), they want a decent, responsible guy to support them financially. They go from spreading their legs for drug addicts and sociopaths to saying that they won’t date any guy who makes under 100K (as if a guy who makes that kind of money wants to date a frumpy, obese bitch in sweatpants).

You do realize that white women are minorities as well right? See, you’re the racist because you actually blame black people for something that white people created in the first place. Affirmative action benefited white women more so than black women and men. Also, affirmative action did not cause Obama to be president. Interesting, Obama is half white (bi-racial) and yet, you call him black. You don’t claim his white side from his mother. Interesting racist you are. When I think of worst president, Ronald Regan qualify because he created the private prisons and expanded the “war on drugs”.
Your mama
Racist^You nailed it. Anyone who bitches and moans about affirmative action just has to look at Obama. At least it’s one government program that seems to work. Pretty amazing really.

We are all of us, evil.
Eve was deceived but Adam disobedient.  Women can be saved from this stigma of leading the human race to sin and death, only through repentance in Christ,… and then even more hope for some of those sisters – rearing godly children in the Lord.
The fall came to mankind by Eve’s actions and so the Lord incarnates himself in the virgin Mary’s womb to make the ultimate sacrifice for sin – once and forever, but not for all sinners.
This incarnation of God to be the God Man, is Jesus, who came that he would destroy the works of the devil.
Sisters in the meetings of the saints are wearing head coverings  You don’t see the men complaining about that.
The man God created first then the woman, and she out from the man.  The woman was to help and be one with the man. Not the other way around.  The genders are different by design.  The order of creation is dripping with meaning.
In a godless society like ours, the culture wants to blur these distinctions in the name of worldly equality and pay.
Just remember – the female, the bible says, are more fragile and instructs Christian men to dwell with them in understanding.
Perfection is but a foretaste in this life but wait until His kingdom is manifested in all of it’s glory.

you’re actually bragging about women taking away other people’s jobs in an economic crisis? That is why I walk straight and don’t look at those feminist fundraisers on the street asking for money. I spit on Betty Friedan’s grave and I would spit on radical feminists like you.
America is losing jobs and families are being destabilised because of the economy.
Feminists can no longer contribute anything meaningful to society. It’s like society rewards the deviant people and punish the ambitious Americans who uphold family values. I don’t mean to sound sexist or homophobic but the inconvenient truth is that someone in the upper echelons of politics and business is trying to destroy the family unit.
Arguing with a feminist is like arguing about religion. It leads to nowhere and leaves a lot of bitterness.

Fast and Furious/Benghazi investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson: Something fishy’s been going on with my computers since early 2011
posted at 10:41 am on May 21, 2013 by Allahpundit
Via the Chris Stigall Show and WPHT in Philadelphia. Two weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been worth posting; Attkisson herself, I suspect, wouldn’t have mentioned it publicly. Even if she’s right about something fishy going on, there are other plausible culprits besides the U.S. government when it comes to reporters’ computers being infiltrated. Two weeks later, though, knowing now that the DOJ was willing to order a dragnet of AP reporters’ phone records and actually read James Rosen’s e-mails, there’s no way around the obvious suspicion. If the feds were willing to monitor Rosen and the AP in the name of cracking down on leakers, why wouldn’t they monitor the one reporter from non-Fox big media who’s done more digging on Fast and Furious and Benghazi than anyone else?
Attkisson told Laura Ingraham in October 2011 that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting. The DOJ wasn’t happy either:
I’m certainly not the one to make the case for DOJ and White House about what I’m doing wrong. They will tell you that I’m the only reporter–as they told me–that is not reasonable. They say the Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, the New York Times is reasonable, I’m the only one who thinks this is a story, and they think I’m unfair and biased by pursuing it.
Which government sources were aiding and abetting this “unreasonable” reporter? There was one obvious way to find out. Any comment, DOJ?
Here’s the clip. The full Stigall podcast can be found here . Obvious exit question: Whether Attkisson was monitored or not, it can’t be just the AP and Rosen whom the feds have snooped on in four years. How many other reporters?

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/21/1210824/-ObamaCare-Betrayal-Big-Corporations-To-Offer-Health-Insurance-NOT-Covering-Hospital-Stays-Surgery|124 Comments
If you work at Bill Miller Bar-B-Q in Texas, ObamaCare means that you'll get the following insurance plan. Oh, you lucky duckies! From the debacle that is putting preservation of private health insurance corporation profits ahead of public health:
San Antonio-based Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, a 4,200-worker chain, will replace its own mini-med with a new, skinny plan in July. The new plan... will cover only preventive services, six annual doctors' visits and generic drugs. X-rays and tests at a local urgent care chain will also be covered. It wouldn't cover surgeries or hospital stays.
You got that right -- thanks to immoral employers -- and gutless politicians and regulators -- big business will be able to offer the same 'shitty deals' to their employees that they have in the past without getting in any trouble:
Employers are increasingly recognizing they may be able to avoid certain penalties under the federal health law by offering very limited plans that can lack key benefits such as hospital coverage.
Benefits advisers and insurance brokers—bucking a commonly held expectation that the law would broadly enrich benefits—are pitching these low-benefit plans around the country. They cover minimal requirements such as preventive services, but often little more. Some of the plans wouldn't cover surgery, X-rays or prenatal care at all.
Federal officials say this type of plan, in concept, would appear to qualify as acceptable minimum coverage under the law, and let most employers avoid an across-the-workforce $2,000-per-worker penalty for firms that offer nothing.
The idea that such plans would be allowable under the law has emerged only recently. Some benefits advisers still feel they could face regulatory uncertainty. The law requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty. Many employers and benefits experts have understood the rules to require robust insurance, covering a list of "essential" benefits such as mental-health services and a high percentage of workers' overall costs.
Say what?! Employers are set to screw over employees by providing them with coverage that won't even help them pay the bill for a broken leg, and the Federal Government is agreeing with these bastards 'in concept'?
Fuck you, Max Baucus, and weak-kneed Health & Human Services bureaucrats:
But a close reading of the rules makes it clear that those mandates affect only plans sponsored by insurers that are sold to small businesses and individuals, federal officials confirm. That affects only about 30 million of the more than 160 million people with private insurance, including 19 million people covered by employers, according to a Citigroup Inc. C +0.20% report. Larger employers, generally with more than 50 workers, need cover only preventive services, without a lifetime or annual dollar-value limit, in order to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty.
Such policies would generally cost far less to provide than paying the penalty or providing more comprehensive benefits, say benefit-services firms.
Administration officials confirmed in interviews that the skinny plans, in concept, would be sufficient to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty. Several expressed surprise that employers would consider the approach.
Of course, our friends at Aetna and Cigna must be drooling over this travesty -- they make big bucks on junk insurance that covers nothing at all.
In short, from Physicians for a National Health Program :
Imagine health insurance not covering hospitalizations nor surgery. Yet this is still possible because the Affordable Care Act applies the essential health benefit requirement only to plans for small businesses and individuals and not to larger employers.
This has opened up the opportunity for a conspiracy between larger employers who could care less whether or not their employees have health insurance and private insurers who are quite willing to sell these almost worthless bare-bones products as long as there is a profitable market for them.
The solution is obvious. Cover all care that people need, and then provide that coverage to everyone, automatically. Maybe these uncaring employers might not like that, but when the taxes to pay for an equitable system are obligatory, they would get used to the idea of their employees being able to obtain health care when they need it. Not such a bad idea after all, especially when their competitors are treated the same.
Our health care non-system is fucking barbaric, cruel and insane.
SinglePayer (Medicare For All) is the only solution -- clearly, our private insurance and corporate overlords are unwilling to submit to the regulatory oversight necessary to make a 'market-based' Swiss system work in this country.

7 Things About The Mainstream Media That They Do Not Want You To Know
By Michael, on May 20th, 2013
Have you ever wondered who controls the mainstream media?  In America today, we are more "connected" than ever.  The average American watches 153 hours of television a month, and we also spend countless hours watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading books and surfing the Internet.  If someone could control the production of all of that media, that would make them immensely powerful.  They would literally be in a position to tell people what to think.  Well, what if I told you that there are just six enormous media conglomerates that combine to produce about 90 percent of all the media that Americans consume.  Would that alarm you?  It should alarm you.  The truth is that our attitudes, opinions and beliefs are greatly shaped by what we allow into our minds.  After all, they don't call it "programming" for no reason.  Even those of us that realize that we are connected to "the matrix" probably greatly underestimate the tremendous influence that the media has over us.  We live at a time when it is absolutely imperative to think for ourselves, but most Americans are being absolutely overwhelmed with information and seem more than content to let others do their thinking for them.  Sadly, this is greatly contributing to the downfall of our society.
And of course the mainstream media desperately does not want you to look at "the man behind the curtain".  They just want you to stay plugged into the "programming" that they are feeding you without asking any questions.
Fortunately, a growing minority of Americans are waking up and are starting to reject the mainstream media.  An increasing number of people are beginning to recognize that the mainstream media is the mouthpiece of the establishment and that it is promoting the agenda of the establishment.
So why is the mainstream media so bad?  The following are 7 things about the mainstream media that they do not want you to know...
#1 The Mainstream Media Has Very Deep Ties To The Establishment
Did you know that the president of CBS and the president of ABC both have brothers that are top officials in the Obama administration?
The big news networks have developed an almost incestuous relationship with the federal government in recent years.  But of course the same could be said of the relationship that the media has with the big corporations that own stock in their parent companies and that advertise on their networks.
This is one of the reasons why we very rarely ever see any hard hitting stories on the big networks anymore.  The flow of information through the corporate-dominated media is very tightly controlled, and there are a lot of gatekeepers that make sure that the "wrong stories" don't get put out to the public.  As a result, many of the "big stories" that have come out in recent years were originally broken by the alternative media.
#2 The Mainstream Media Gets Things Wrong Very Frequently
Even prominent members of the mainstream media admit that this is the case.  For example, during a recent speech at Quinnipiac University CBS anchor Scott Pelley confessed that journalists in the mainstream media " are getting big stories wrong, over and over again" ...
"Let me take the first arrow: During our coverage of Newtown, I sat on my set and I reported that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the school. And that her son had attacked her classroom. It's a hell of a story, but it was dead wrong. Now, I was the managing editor, I made the decision to go ahead with that and I did, and that's what I said, and I was absolutely wrong. So let me just take the first arrow here."
#3 The American Public Does Not Consider The Media To Be Very Trustworthy
Trust in the mainstream media has definitely been slipping.  In fact, a Gallup poll taken last year found that distrust of the media had reached an all-time high .  According to that poll, 60 percent of Americans "have little or no trust" that the media is reporting the news accurately.
A separate Rasmussen Reports survey found that only 6 percent of all Americans consider the news media to be "very trustworthy".
Hopefully this trend will accelerate and a lot more people will stop trusting the media blindly.
#4 The Mainstream Media And The Politicians That They Worship Hate The Fact That They Cannot Control Internet News Sites
In the old days, the mainstream media had a virtual monopoly on the news.  But these days, anyone with an Internet connection can put up a news site, and this is driving the establishment absolutely bonkers.
For example, Barack Obama is known to have a great dislike for the alternative media.  The following is from a recent  WND article ...
NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd says President Obama was making it “clear” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner over the weekend how he feels about the rise of Internet news sites like Politico, Buzzfeed and … well, WND.
“He hates it.”
Appearing on “Meet the Press” Sunday morning following Saturday night’s media, politics and celebrity soiree, Todd explained the president’s disdain for independent online news sources was showing during his speech.
“It did seem … I thought his pot shots, joke-wise, and then the serious stuff about the Internet, the rise of the Internet media and social media and all that stuff – he hates it, OK? He hates this part of the media,” Todd said. “He really thinks that the, sort of, the buzzification – this isn’t just about Buzzfeed or Politico and all this stuff – he thinks that sort of coverage of political media has hurt political discourse. He hates it. And I think he was just trying to make that clear last night.”
#5 The Mainstream Media Is Extremely Liberal
When it comes to politics, the mainstream media is far more liberal than the general population is.
For example, one survey found that  41 percent of American voters believe that the average reporter is more liberal than they are, while only 18 percent believe that the average reporter is more conservative than they are.
A very disturbing UCLA study on media bias discovered that the vast majority of media outlets are "left of center"...
Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS’ “Evening News,” The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal.
And even MSNBC has confirmed the liberal bias of the media.  According to MSNBC , mainstream journalists are far more likely to donate their own money to Democrats than they are to Republicans...
MSNBC.com identified 143 journalists who made political contributions from 2004 through the start of the 2008 campaign, according to the public records of the Federal Election Commission. Most of the newsroom checkbooks leaned to the left: 125 journalists gave to Democrats and liberal causes. Only 16 gave to Republicans. Two gave to both parties.
#6 Six Mammoth Media Corporations Produce About 90 Percent Of The Media That Americans Consume
As I mentioned at the top of this article, there are six giant media behemoths that control almost all of the media that we consume.  These corporate giants own television networks, cable channels, movie studios, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, video game makers, music labels and even many of our favorite websites.
The media ownership chart posted below originally comes from a previous article that I authored entitled " Who Owns The Media? The 6 Monolithic Corporations That Control Almost Everything We Watch, Hear And Read ", but it has been updated to reflect some of the latest information.  The power that these companies have is so vast that it is hard to put into words...

#7 The American People Are Absolutely Addicted To The Mainstream Media
In a previous article about the media , I noted that the average American watches 153 hours of television a month.
When you allow that much information to be downloaded into your brain, it is going to have a dramatic impact on how you think.
Americans are more "connected" than they ever have been before.  This is especially true of our kids.  They are constantly on one sort of electronic device or another.  The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Daniel Taylor ...
According to a 2010 LA Times report , young people spend on average 53 hours a week watching TV, playing video games, and sitting at the computer.
Facebook users spend about 15 hours a month on the social networking site.
People are walking – and driving – blindly while texting, sometimes walking into fountains and even falling off cliffs.
If that Los Angeles Times report is true, that means that our young people are spending more than 200 hours a month connected to the media.
But we are only awake for about 480 hours a month.
When it comes to influencing the American people, nobody has more power than the big media companies do.
And until we can break this sick addiction to the mainstream media and get people to start thinking for themselves, we will never see widespread changes in our society.  As long as people are being "programmed" by the mainstream media, they will continue to express the opinions, attitudes and beliefs that have been downloaded into their minds.
Please share this article with as many people as you can.  It is crucial that we wake as many people up as possible while we still can.

Turning it off is the best thing any of us can do to fight back.  When your friends and family start talking about this or that on TV, say “sorry, we don’t watch TV” and check out the look on their faces.  We’ve been a Zero TV Home since 1998 and love that look.  And we don’t miss TV one tiny bit.

I don’t believe it is either “right” or “left”, as I talked to someone on the left who is truely unhappy with the media!  (Genuine left wing ideas, not what the media portrays as left.).

That’s exactly what they want you to think! “L v R.” How about there is no difference between the two parties? If there were, you’d actually see laws that one side passed being overturned by the other, yet that is NEVER the case. I’ve watched this for 60 years and it’s always the same. The only difference is that each election cycle new people take a side. Wake up folks! There’s only one side and you aren’t on it!

Those six media giants that control everything are themselves part of a world-wide, intertwined group of ultra-powerful corporations that are, in turn, controlled by a number of mega-corporations under the most powerful families on Earth.

New Scientist Magazine released the data in Q2/2012 of who the 147 corporations are that control 85% of the worlds wealth.

I don’t think many people here are quite grasping what you mean by “super rich”.  Very few Hollywood type celebrities are even close to super wealthy, they have just enough to shut them up and keep them entertaining the peasants.
Come to think of it I don’t think they get what you mean by liberal either.  Bill Gates and George Soros?  Super wealthy, yes, liberal, well I think that’s debatable.  It’s one thing to talk the talk and throw a little money to charity as a token gesture, it’s quite another to actually accept a downgrade in one’s own lifestyle in order to allow others a chance in the game of life.  Names like Rockefeller are what we’re really looking at when we talk about super rich, and I don’t think they have ever been accused of being liberal.

That’s why none of these scandals will affect Obama, no matter how bad they get.  The mainstream media won’t go after him like they went after Nixon, in fact they will cover for him.

Agreed, but it’s how the govt media complex and the public school system have conditioned us over the last 40-50 years so Mission accomplished !
And now the govt wants to make sure it stays that way by buying up all the ammo, disarming American citizens while stockpiling their own inventory. We have said it here many times but even today Rush admitted we have become the Banana Republic of America.

Ironically, Rush Bimbo is and has been a part of the problem.  Just like Pawn Hannity and others, they supported/defended GWB’s TYRANNY and then they talk against Obama’s TYRANNY, when in fact it all goes hand in hand!  That is their job, the PROSTITUTES in the media, to keep you all confused with the 2 party…1 party system.  You all believe their is one ounce of difference in the 2 parties???  Yes…you say.  Ahhh, the production based programming for theater is working just as it was designed to…for you SHEEPLE!
El Pollo de Oro
Ricky Ross; Very insightful post. Rush “Pillhead” Limbaugh (the OxyContin king), Bill-O The Clown and other neocons are propagandists for the Repuli-Con wing of the War Party, while MSNBC (also known as ONN, the Obama News Network) are propagandists for the Democrap wing of the War Party. But the American sheeple, to a large degree, are gullible tribalists. So they could care less how much “our guy” rapes and pillages as long as it is “our guy.” Faux News and MSNBC serve different wings of the War Party, but both serve the War Party.
“Barack Obama is so dangerous because he makes people that are traditionally anti-torture, anti-war, anti-police state just say, ‘Hey, I want NDAA. I want troops on the street. I want TSA sticking their hands down our pants. I want banker bailouts because it’s Obama.’  And strong conservatives went to sleep under Bush because hey, he’s a Republican.”—Alex Jones
“All the two parties are fighting for is who gets to
be the whore, the prostitute for the interest groups.”—Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
“I will not vote for the lesser of two evils. I will not support this criminality any
longer. I will not vote for the Gambinos or the Bonannos. I will not vote for the Republicans or the Democrats. To me, it’s a two-bit freak show.”—Gerald Celente
Lennie Pike
I agree. There will be outrage from Fox News, “conservative” radio, and the Republican Party – all a kabooki show for people who do not think for themselves. Control the fiat money scam and “they” control everything and everyone – almost
but unfortunately for them, not quite enough.

These so-called scandals have yet to place any criminality in the hands of the White House, unlike Watergate.
jaxon64
I honestly believe that Obama could be found–concrete and irrefutable evidence–to have ordered guns given to Mexican drug cartels, or given weapons to Al Quaeda in Libya which were used to kill Americans and destroy our embassy, or even joked about his use of the IRS to bully his political opponents–there could be evidence that he had his hand directly in all of these things and he would still be untouched……
OH, WAIT!!!….He actually was complicit in all of these events and the public and media responds with a yawn.
He could probably get caught like Marion Barry of DC with a crack pipe and hooker on tape and would still have tens of millions fawning at his feet………
Obama (like Oprah) is a cult………

The IMF, World Bank and UN were setup for a specific purpose.
There biggest obstacle to their “end game” has been too many people “waking up” and taking action.
The numbers doing the latter need to increase dramatically.  Many have put their lives in jeopardy for doing so.  The “elite” will stop at nothing to achieve their final objective.

Web-search them.

I agree. In another article I wrote about this. I blame the feminist movement. They took the most important role in society and vilified it. Then, they convinced the women that they MUST join the slave/work force to be considered successful. Pitiful, but it worked just like it was supposed to. And now look at us.

Feminism also substantially increased the tax revenue that the IRS could collect.  They referred to it as the other 50%.
In a planned double whammy (see Rockefeller history), it also led to the breakup of the traditional family unit where kids were simply passed to the “State” for education.  The parents got bizzy elsewhere.
Other things have been strongly promoted since and it is being pushed everywhere left, right and centre.  The aim is moral and societal destruction at every conceivable level.
I will refrain from naming the specific group who are responsible for such outrageous mayhem.  They create war as well.
They also electronically create money in a similar fashion to yanking a rabbit out of a hat then charging the public for the pet food to keep all the rabbits alive.
Those in their 40′s/50′s/60′s plus must be going through a daily mind warp trying to figure it all out.

Children are born with a clean slate, pure, with no ideological hang-ups to dampen their wonder of the world around them.  It’s the parents and society that teaches them to be bigoted, and they mimic their parents bigotry because they adore them and want to please them.  Personally I think having two loving parents, regardless of gender, is worth a lot more to a child than having one or two dysfunctional ones.  But, sigh, homophobia is a great distraction from the real issues at hand, and it works wonders to divide communities.

What stuns me the most is this: this week, Obama’s approval rating actually increased to 53%, despite the scandals going on. This just goes to show how apathetic most Americans have become. Even worse, this sends the message that Obama, and the Government as a whole, can pretty much do whatever they want at this point, since the public is unlikely to go after them. If this isn’t a bad sign, I don’t know what is.

assuming the 53% is real……..

Yep, about as real as the unemployment numbers.

Wait…let me guess…you got that 53% number from….THE MEDIA! Just goes to show you that no matter how much someone dislikes or distrusts the MSM…for some reason they STILL believe some of the true garbage they pump out…53%…I don’t think so…IT’S THE MEDIA PEOPLE!

I don’t know.  Each day I become more convinced that people are getting dumber and dumber so it’s plausible to me that 53% of our population are stupid enough to approve.

Brainiac was a UK TV series that prove how quickly thermite could melt through a car engine block.
Funny, all the post 9/11 tests I saw of the substance being ignited in America made one think it can’t “cut” through steel.

Brainiac was also a continuing character in DC comic books in the 60′s and 70′s. He was a green skinned, super intelligent android that regularly crossed swords with Superman.  He had stolen an entire Kryptonian city before the planet was destroyed when it’s sun went nova, and kept it miniaturized in a bottle so that he could study the inhabitants.  Superman got wind of this and recovered Kandor after an epic battle with Bainiac.

You can forget making people “wake up”. America is the most TV saturated country on the planet. People can’t get enough of crap on TV. No one watches more TV in the world than Americans. I recommend the movie “Network” which predicted all of these things over 30 years ago.

The problem you speak of comes from a lack of cerebral coherence between the two hemispheres.  The vast majority of people are “left brain dominant”.
It is the “ego” which causes all the problems and when left unchecked, it becomes sociopathic, narcissistic and psychopathic in its nature.

yes, the mainstream media is our enemy. A wise person knows their enemy inside and out. Watching the national news is NOT a waste of time. I watch every night then go and find the truth by other means and measure the difference.

I love to compare and contrast the way the different news outlets portray situations.  They can certainly draw opposite conclusions among them.  They especially love to isolate one seemingly positive bit of economic news and try to convince the viewers that we’re in a real recovery. Never mind the other negative bits that continue to decline.
Graham
Yes… we are in a “recovery” and hopefully it will continue to blossom.
I refer to the many who appear to be rediscovering their own voice, sanity and consciousness (waking up).
Graham
Likewise.  I strongly believe all sides of the coin have to be observed in order to properly dissect and compartmentalise who is saying what and why.
As the MSM ratings continue to suffer, I note they refer often to the alternate media, usually trying to beat it down.  This will change after the recent “trilogy” of high profile “blunders”.
Even BritBoy Redcoat Pierce Morgan is changing his tune on the tyranny front.  Next week he will likely be pushing 3D printers or the new laser rifle.

The mainstream aka government controlled media is the tool by which we are heading like a speed train to secular totalitarianism and pervasive evil. The government and the media [except for Newscorp/Fox] is the means by which traditional America and our founding Judaio-Christian value system is evaporating. If the true facts of a story cannot be controlled, manipulated to fit the mainstream left wing secular outcome, it is ignored by all of the large media outlets. Remember how the lefty devils in the media ran with the phony rigged up Duke Lacrosse rape case until they could not push the lie any further ? There have been countless examples since 8+15+1969, where the mainstream liars contorted or ignored facts to fit their secular outcome.I used to sit and watch the evening news in the 70′s with my mother. I would ask her why the three networks would cover the same stories. She did not know then, but we all know now.  Recently, the murdering infanticide doctors Gosnell and the latest from Texas receive almost no coverage by the secular totalitarian left. Remember the liars on the left saying that legal abortion, aka murder, would prevent back alley abortions. MURDERING LIARS. Look at these death camps run by Planned Parenthood. The blaspemy by OB asking God to bless PP was outragious. Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Lifers assemble peacefully in Washington each year and this receives little to no coverage from the government controlled media. The crushing budget deficits and the national debt receives almost no coverage. Pres. Obama would not have been able to pass a security clearance for most government jobs and is our sitting President for two terms because the government controlled media decided to ignore his school records and much of his past. Mitt Romney, a good virtuous man, was run out of town by the demons on the left. The left wing media knows that Benghazi is 10 times worse than Watergate and will only give it slight coverage. The government controlled company line and outcome is that we will learn from it and we will move forward. The phony Watergate scandal was drilled into our heads for ten years. No Americans died because of Watergate but we fed four Americans to the wolves in Benghazi. American lives are wothless to these globalist totalitarians. Meanwhile, we have wire tapping and spying going on 24/7. When will America wake up ? When will America sober up and realize that this secularsocial experiment which metastasised on 8+15+1969 is a world wrecking failure. Shame on you Judas Catholics for what your have done.

Back in the day when the MSM was not a parrot to the shadow gubermint, one would hear news stories from different MSM outlets and they would never be identical like today. You could tell each news outlet was doing their own work and seeing things differently. Not today….and technology has nothing to do with it. It’s no secret the shadow gubermint is in bed with the media…more like the media’s masters and overseers. Always remember the 3 tools these miscreants have at their  disposal: Intimidation…Manipulation…Provocation. 99% of the time you can attribute at least 1 of these tools to their dirty deeds…it’s their finger print.

The inability of the elites to control anything led them to push mainstream media on the forefront with the false hope that by manipulating peoples perceptions and beliefs would convince everybody that they are in control when in reality they cannot drive their own car.
They really think that people can be totally programmed to believe that some super wealthy elite is pulling all the strings on this planet and everybody else should bow down to them.
Very funny. Our elites are becoming our clowns!

This administration is using the cheating wife technique. "Even if caught in the act, deny everything."
As long as they do that and have the support of the news media, they hope to hold out until the news media puts everyone back to sleep.

You're right on top of it. Petraeus was a four star general and the director of the CIA. I find it hard to believe there was something happening like this and he was totally out of the loop.
As the CIA director he probably had to accept the loss of life as the leader of the Agency. As a military man, it appears he abandoned the two brave seals. If he did know something and testified to it it would show that he still had military character. If he didn't know anything he was probably padding his pension as the CIA director. But as four star generals go, he might as well have got the stars as prizes from Cracker Jack

(And then remove the Commanders that wanted to rush in help!)  Plus deliberately sending that Ambassador into that specific place and time and then the attack starts within one hour of time of his scheduled meeting.  Explain that behavior.  The best explanations I've seen is that the intent was to set up a kidnapping of the Ambassador for an exchange for the Egyptian Cleric we hold in jail (AND that Obama had tried earlier to send back to Egypt but Congress intervened).  The motive could have been to make Obama look strong in foreign relations just before the election.  I have no idea if that was true, but the explanations that the administration has provided DO NOT support what happened.
Only the explanation that the attack was expected and supported for "some" purpose provides the motive for the repeated denied extra security and repeated "Stand Down" orders given to do those that wanted and COULD HAVE provided aid.
Other explanations center around the likelihood of secret arms shipments being passed through Libya orchestrated by Ambassador Stevens.  But I don't think it explains the clear effort to deny security and aid.  Somebody wanted the bad guys at the gate to be successful in their intrusion.  My guess it wasn't supposed to kill anyone but the four Seals that returned to help (although having been told NOT to) provided a means to fight back and things soon got out of control.  Then the administration was in need of do some very fast track covering to avoid discovery.  The FBI wasn't even on site to do any investigating until a MONTH later.  And all the injured where kept away from the press.  And Hillary suddenly banged her head and avoided Congress.  Delay, delay.  Nothing to see here, move on.  And now,  of course, we hear from Hillary, "What Difference Does It Make??".  Clearly they hope that the answer is now that it doesn't..
Just the normal bumbling of the administration does not explain why they took such coordinated efforts to avoid providing aid.  There was NO real risk to the politicians in sending aid.  In fact, it was the LOW risk decision even if it was too late.   But it was actively denied.  Politicians would want to be seen as acting to help UNLESS something else more important to them was intended.
Note, that the whole IRS mess was deliberately released by the Gov itself!!  Just imagine that.  WHY would the IRS be told to tell a reporter to ask a specific question at a press conference just to be able to reveal what they've been up to.  We would not even have knowledge of what the IRS had been doing without having the culprits themselves revealing it!!!  (Plus it is a scandal that Obama is personally well isolated from while the Benghazi affair he ISN'T.)  Remember the best way to refocus an investigation is to start a bigger or more visible or more accessible fire somewhere else.
I'm not a conspiracy nut, but clearly this administration is fully capable of using false flags and false rescues if it served their political purposes.  These guys have NO moral compasses.  (Most politicians are capable of such.)
I suspect that if the truth does come out, Obama could be impeached.  But he has incredible powers to keep things suppressed, dodge the blame and pin the responsibility elsewhere.  I'm not overly confident that we'll know the truth while he is in office.  Maybe never.  But keeping such big secrets is very difficult especially after the culprit is no longer President and no longer has suppressive powers.
Don’t let up.  Keep digging.  Clearly there is something VERY, VERY, VALUABLE buried there.  They’ll take almost any scandal hit rather than let Benghazi be fully discovered.

More than a few people think it was a hit, that Stevens had to go. Whatever the true story, it is lethal, and it is why the other scandals emerged at the same time. They do not want this uncovered.

I've always thought the video was a loose end (among all the others). If they already knew it was a crock, how come it surfaced so conveniently? And how come the producer Noukala is still in prison? Something else stinks from that angle.

WASHINGTON – Antiwar.com is taking the FBI to court.
The website’s founder and managing editor Eric Garris, along with longtime editorial director Justin Raimondo, filed a lawsuit in federal court today, demanding the release of records they believe the FBI is keeping on them and the 17-year-old online magazine.
Antiwar.com says this is one more example of post-9/11 government overreach, and a stark reminder that the First Amendment has been treated as little more than a speed bump on the road to a government surveillance state. The lawsuit is particularly timely, considering recent scandals in which the Department of Justice secretly seized months of journalists’ phone records at the Associated Press, and did the same and more to a FOX News reporter , while the IRS is acknowledging it singled out conservative groups that criticize the government for extra scrutiny.
Suddenly, the press is more aware than ever that the state has the ability to secretly monitor its activities, heretofore thought of as constitutionally protected from government interference and intimidation.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy, whether it’s AP or Antiwar.com,” said Julia Harumi Mass, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which is representing Antiwar.com in the case. “FBI surveillance of news organizations interferes with journalists’ ability to do their jobs as watchdogs that hold the government accountable.”
The suit was filed on Tuesday at the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. Both Garris and Raimondo live and work in the San Francisco Bay area.
According to the suit, the ACLU has made several futile attempts to obtain the FBI files since a reader alerted Garris and Raimondo to this lengthy FBI memo in 2011. The details in question begin at page 62 of the heavily redacted 94-page document. It’s clear from these documents, the suit alleges, that the FBI has files on Garris and Raimondo, and at one point the FBI agent writing the April 30, 2004 memo on Antiwar.com recommends further monitoring of the website in the form of opening a “preliminary investigation …to determine if [redaction] are engaging in, or have engaged in, activities which constitute a threat to national security.”
“On one hand it seemed almost funny that we would be considered a threat to national security, but it’s very scary, because what we are engaging in is free speech, and free speech by ordinary citizens and journalists is now being considered a threat to national security and they don’t have to prove it because the government has the ability to suppress information and not disclose any of their activities – as witnessed with what is going on now at the AP and other things,” said Garris.
“The government’s attitude is they want to know all, but they want the public to know as little as possible.”
In response, the ACLU began filing requests in December 2011 under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for any records the FBI was currently holding on Antiwar.com, which describes itself as a Libertarian-inspired project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. It was clear from reading the memo that Antiwar.com came under the radar in part for its mission, which is characterized as publishing a non-interventionist “online magazine and research tool designed to keep the American people and the world informed about the overseas plans of the American government.” [Full disclosure, this writer is a regular contributor].
While openly acknowledging that we have an agenda, the editors take seriously our purely journalistic mission, which is to get past the media filters and reveal the truth about America’s foreign policy. Citing a wide variety of sources without fear or favor, and presenting our own views in the regular columns of various contributors, we clearly differentiate between fact and opinion, and let our readers know which is which.
The website was also targeted, according to the FBI memo, for links it published to counter-terrorism watch lists (which were already in the public domain), and for the people who were visiting Antiwar.com and/or talking it up at rallies. The FBI noted at least two of Raimondo’s columns and wondered openly, “who are (Antiwar.com’s) contributors and what are the funds utilized for?” This, after acknowledging there was no evidence of any crime being plotted or committed.
“This illustrates the troubling, continuing efforts of the federal government to monitor protected speech activity without evidence or even allegation of criminal activity,” said Mass, who explained that there are specific prohibitions against such surveillance and record-keeping in the 1974 Privacy Act [5 U.S.C 552a(e)(7)] .
After Raimondo wrote about the FBI memo in August 2011 , which at the time, independent journalist Marcy Wheeler at EmptyWheel.net deemed a “troubling story,” Antiwar.com started losing donors, and according to the lawsuit, it was big time.
In October 2011, one of Antiwar.com’s major donors withdrew his financial support from Antiwar.com out of concern that the FBI would monitor him if he continued to provide, as he wished to do, financial support to Antiwar.com. Since then, three significant donors have also withdrawn financial support, citing their fear that FBI interest in Antiwar.com would lead to surveillance of the donors as a reason for withdrawing financial support. As a result, Antiwar.com has lost about $75,000 per year since 2011 in otherwise expected contributions.
Reached over the weekend, Wheeler, who routinely investigates and reports on the impact of post-9/11 government surveillance on civil liberties for EmptyWheel.net , voiced her concern about the apparent FBI surveillance of Antiwar.com and its far-reaching implications.
“It’s likely (the) FBI is hiding one or another things: Bush era investigations into the peace community that were improper to start with, and/or the degree to which First Amendment activities have become one reason to investigate completely innocent activity,” she said.
After a series of FOIA requests, amended requests and empty responses, Garris and Raimondo have “received no agency determination setting forth whether Defendant FBI intends to produce records or any basis for withholding them,” since the last request dated May 24, 2012. Taking it to court, Mass said, is the next step.
“Our clients are entitled to obtain records the FBI has gathered about them and their online magazine,” she said. “This is especially important because the FBI’s surveillance has impacted our clients’ ability to maintain support for their website and has impacted their editorial choices– exactly the type of harm the First Amendment is supposed to protect against.”
How it went down
The strange and unsettling story of Antiwar.com’s debut into the domestic War on Terror came in the summer of 2011, when a reader warned Garris and Raimondo that the website had been mentioned as a target of surveillance by the FBI in the batch of documents the reader said he obtained through a FOIA request and had subsequently posted on his blog.
The documents mostly concern a 2001 investigation of five Israeli nationals who were witnessed smiling and celebrating and taking pictures of the burning Twin Towers from a rooftop perch across the river from Manhattan in Union City, New Jersey, on 9/11. After witnesses called the police, the individuals, who all worked for a local moving company, were taken into custody and grilled by FBI and CIA for two months after it was deemed their work visas had expired, and there was a big wad of cash, box cutters and other items that raised red flags found in a search of their work van. Questions revolved around whether the Israelis were spies connected to the Israeli government, and whether they had foreknowledge of the tragic events.
The heavily redacted memo says the men were eventually deported back to Israel without charge, and the case closed. However, the FBI still had an interest in tracking evidence gleaned from the case and this is where Antiwar.com comes into the picture. Raimondo, in writing about the case of the five Israelis in 2002 , linked to an American-generated terror watchlist (which had been published elsewhere on the Internet) that went out to Italian financial institutions and it included the name of the man who owned the New Jersey moving company in question.
It is not clear whether this sparked further monitoring of Antiwar.com, or whether Antiwar.com was already in the FBI’s sights. Interestingly, the memo states that the information attached to the memo as supporting material (none of which was available, aside from copies of two of Raimondo’s articles), was obtained in part through a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) request.
The FBI said it also searched the Web, as well as Lexis-Nexis, the Universal Index (FBI central records), the agency’s Electronic Case File, Department of Motor Vehicles and Dunn & Bradsheet (credit reports) for information on Antiwar.com and for “one or more individuals” working for the website.
Some of the things that can be discerned from those searches and were noted in the FBI memo:
– That Raimondo had been writing about the five Israelis and in his columns linked to at least three different terror watch lists (all found in the public domain).
–That Antiwar.com was cited in an article, the name of the author redacted, about U.S aid to Israel.
– That an article that listed Antiwar.com as a reference was handed out in 2002 at a “peaceful protest” at a British air base in the U.K.
– That a member of a domestic neo-Nazi group had “discussed a website, Antiwar.com” while encouraging fellow members at a conference to “educate themselves” about the Middle East conflict.
– That a special agent’s review of hard drives seized during an investigation of an unnamed subject, revealed that the subject had visited Antiwar.com between July 25, 2002 and June 15, 2003, “among many other websites.”
“There are several unanswered questions regarding www.antiwar.com,” reads the FBI memo. “It describes itself as a non-profit group that survives on generous contributions from its readers. Who are these contributors and what are the funds used for?”
The memo goes on to say that “many individuals worldwide do view this website including individuals who are currently under investigation and [two lines redacted].”
The unidentified agent writing the memo concludes, “it is recommended that ECAU (Electronic Communications Analysis Unit) further monitor the postings on the website … it is recommended that a PI (preliminary investigation) is opened to determine if [line redacted] have engaged in, or are engaging in, activities which constitute a threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power.”
This is the decisive point of the memo as it pertains to Antiwar.com: that Garris and Raimondo and Antiwar.com, for writing about a particularly sensitive subject and for linking to information that is already circulating around the Internet, may be a “threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power,” and therefore subject to secret surveillance. That would make any journalist, who say, linked a story to documents published by Wikileaks, which is currently under federal investigation , suspect too, surmised the plaintiffs.
“This sort of government activity is so chilling because it puts the fear of government at a higher level, and among the news media,” said Garris, noting the negative effect that federal leak investigations are already having on the free press. “Once the people aren’t able to get information, the government can, potentially, have unlimited power.”
According to Mass, the ACLU is filing a separate, administrative request to the FBI to find and further expunge any files it may have on Garris and Raimondo.
“The government,” concluded Mass, “cannot keep records about people’s exercise of free speech unless it is related to a criminal investigation.”
Update: Antiwar.com contacted the FBI for a statement for this story. A press official there declined, saying the agency could not comment on pending litigation.

Power and force are the name of the game.

The Obama administration has gotten itself into a fix between its contradictory stories about the Benghazi incident, reports of the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Justice Department’s grabbing of phone records from AP reporters. There are few things more fun to watch than arrogant political leaders -- folks who spend their lives bossing everyone around -- getting a comeuppance.
RELATED ARTICLES
Regulation
My favorite take wasn’t from any serious commentator but from comedian Jon Stewart, who noticed that the president routinely claims ignorance about embarrassing events by saying that he learned of them while watching the news: “I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announcing it on television.”
I take a bipartisan approach to Washington, DC’s political scandals and find myself savoring them all, regardless of the party that is in control of the White House. Any sane person would conclude that all administrations and bureaucracies essentially are corrupt given that they thrive on the exertion of power of other people. We know about the corrupting influence of power, and DC has become like ancient Rome that way. It’s a magnet for those seeking favor, money, or a big title administering some pointless program.
I visited DC last week and was astounded at the booming economy, the endless new construction, the astronomical prices, and garish displays of wealth everywhere -- not to mention the haughty attitudes of every pissant assistant to the whatever. That’s what Other People’s Money buys you. When Ronald Reagan talked about the Shining City on the Hill he was speaking metaphorically about America, but the new shining city is DC -- funded on the backs of all those Americans who blithely vote for people who promise to solve their problems.
That’s the main lesson from this latest mess: the federal government is an untamable beast. These superficial scandals are nothing compared to the things we will never learn -- i.e., the way the CIA conducts its business overseas.
Still, there are so many things to savor as President Obama circles the drain. Obama has always exuded an intellectual arrogance. Yet if he’s so smart, why would his Justice Department target reporters? The national media has fawned over the president, but the quickest way to end that love affair is to go after their personal records.
Unfortunately, many people insist on seeing every scandal in terms of partisanship. Conservatives are aghast, as they should be, at the thought of an IRS auditing groups based on their political views. That is eerily totalitarian. But where would they have been had a Republican administration done the same thing to liberal critics? I doubt the activist groups would be sending out the alarmist direct-mail pieces if the latest Bush were still president.
The best news from the ongoing drama is that people on the left and right see problems here. Let’s use that as a foundation for a renewed civil-liberties coalition that understands that there are many bright red lines in which the government -- regardless of who nominally is at the head of it -- does not cross. That’s easier to do when one realizes that our supposedly limited government is so limitless in its size, power, and taxing ability that no president can control it.
When pundits complain about excess partisanship, what they usually are really saying is they are tired of all the political fighting. Yet political fighting is good -- it’s a sign of differences of opinion and assures that important issues get debated, however clumsily, in the public.
In Sacramento, California, the Republican Party has imploded and there is little worry about partisanship. But the state’s Democratic Party is now engaged in policies so secretive that even liberal-oriented pundits are getting concerned. No one has the power to say no, so the Democrats are ramming through every manner of dangerous bill.
The new health-exchange law shields most contracts under a veil of secrecy so that public money can be dispensed to friends and cronies without the public learning about where it is going. Democratic leaders have embraced a gut-and-amend frenzy -- proposing dozens of bills with placeholder language that will be stripped away at the last minute with new and completely different language inserted. This circumvents normal debate and oversight.
This is not a Democratic problem per se, but a government problem. And local governments are arguably even more dangerous to our liberties. In Bakersfield recently, after Kern County sheriff’s deputies beat to death a young father (after being called to the scene for a minor incident -- public drunkenness), they grabbed the cellphones of bystanders who were recording the incident. That’s right out of a police state.
Government is about power and force. Many people charged with power over others will abuse it. That’s human nature. Unfortunately, the nation’s founding ideals -- limited, accountable government, with separated powers and checks and balances -- have been fading away. Government is so big that even the president and the attorney general claim they have no idea what their departments are doing. I almost believe them.
We need to rebuild a coalition of civil libertarians of the left and right who agree to some basics, on some bright red lines that no government should cross. We need to provide a unified, bipartisan front on behalf of individual liberties and against any official from any party who would trample them. Maybe we can learn that constructive lesson from the administration’s unreconstructed behavior.

Yeah I have seen this before, I would love to search the web for more enlightening vids on people like this but geez, time is never on my side. I can't believe he openly said people need to be brainwashed, if that's not proof﻿ that the government does the subliminal messaging, you'll never wake up. God gave us freewill, brainwashing is just another example that our leaders are GODLESS. Our government has forsaken us, abandoned EVERYTHING our forefathers wanted, DONE what they had warned.

Tom Coburn, James Inhofe(Credit: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/AP/Sue Ogrocki)
Just a week ago, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe suggested that President Obama might be impeached over the Benghazi non-scandal. Now, Inhofe must watch as Obama declares Inhofe’s state a disaster area and promises Oklahomans “all the resources they need at their disposal.”
Inhofe, of course, believes his state deserves those resources, even though he voted down aid to Hurricane Sandy victims. On MSNBC, Chris Jansing confronted Inhofe about his calling the Sandy aid bill a “slush fund,” and the brazen right-winger insisted the two issues shouldn’t be linked.
“Let’s look at that, that was totally different,” Inhofe told Jansing. “They were getting things — for instance that was supposed to be in New Jersey, they had things in the Virgin Islands, they were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C.; everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma.”
Inhofe’s answer is too dishonest to fully parse. First of all, there was Sandy damage way beyond New Jersey, including in the Caribbean and in Washington, D.C., too. And Inhofe had different objections to the Sandy bill at the time. In a rambling, hard-to-follow Senate floor speech blocking Sandy aid last December, the Oklahoma conservative objected to the bill’s timing — “There’s always a lot of theater right before Christmas time … We shouldn’t be talking about it right before Christmas” — even though it was already going on two months since the storm ravaged the East Coast.
Inhofe was also exercised by the fact that the Sandy bill included what he said was $28 billion for future disasters. But the climate-change denier was particularly outraged that the bill included $3.5 billion to deal with what he called “global warming,” which led to a long rant against cap-and-trade legislation, and then his floor speech unraveled. (Interestingly, Inhofe’s own press operation put the incoherent speech up on YouTube , as though it was a proud moment for the senator.)
Oklahoma’s other GOP senator, Tom Coburn, brags that he’s going to seek tornado relief — but insist that the funding is “offset” by other cuts to the federal budget. Coburn is proud that he’s being consistent by placing the same conditions on disaster aid to his own state as he’s demanded elsewhere. Consistent, maybe — but also fundamentally cruel.
Especially in the wake of the sequester cuts, the notion that the federal budget is larded with easily eliminated spending is ludicrous. Would Coburn like to see more kids thrown out of Head Start? More seniors losing Meals on Wheels? The federal deficit is shrinking faster than at any time since just after World War II, but Coburn is going to insist that someone, somewhere, must lose their federal help so Oklahoma can get it instead.
There’s something so typical about today’s GOP in the way Inhofe can dismiss comparisons between tornado aid and Sandy aid while Coburn grandstands for his long-term demand that new spending, even on disaster relief, must be “offset” by cuts elsewhere. Meanwhile, the notion that a new disaster relief bill should include funding to cope with future disasters isn’t lauded as common sense, it’s derided as pork. Like Inhofe, Coburn objected to the Sandy bill’s including funding for future disaster relief. (It should be noted that Moore, Okla., Rep. Tom Cole, also a Republican, voted for the Sandy aid bill.)
Just as modern conservatism helped create categories of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor, we now apparently have deserving and undeserving disasters. When tragedy strikes, most Americans tend to want to pull together, but many Republicans look to pull us apart, placing their own constituents’ needs above everyone else’s.

May 21, 2013,  5:39 PM
E.W. Jackson, the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor, began his career as a minister and attorney in Boston. While there, he lent his support to a high-profile 1988 fight against a plan to desegregate public housing developments in the neighborhood of South Boston.
The 1988 battle over housing desegregation in South Boston began after the federal government found the city of Boston had illegally segregated public housing and prevented African Americans from moving into public developments in the neighborhood. Boston was ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to come up with a new tenant selection plan or face a federal takeover of its public housing system. As a result, Ray Flynn, the city’s mayor, came up with a desegregation plan.
Local news station WGBH filmed Jackson giving a speech at a July 1988 community meeting in South Boston hosted by opponents of the mayor’s desegregation plan. According to WGBH, at the event Jackson dismissed the desegregation plan as “social engineering.” In his remarks, Jackson characterized the matter as a question of freedom of choice.
“I am so tired of hearing the people of South Boston dumped on by the saviors of mankind that it makes me nauseous,” Jackson said of desegregation advocates. “I can understand the reaction of the people of South Boston apart from the racial issue because I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either.”
Jackson, who was identified as a radio station manager and pastor of the New Corner Baptist Church in Roxbury, also spoke with a reporter from WGBH. In the interview, he indicated he believed people should be allowed to choose to live separately from members of other races.
“I think that maximum emphasis needs to be put on the ability of people to choose, even if that means some housing developments are predominantly of one race or another,” said Jackson.
The reporter who interviewed him also asked Jackson, who is African-American, if he felt as though he was being “used” by white politicians who opposed the desegregation plan. His response made it clear he fully supported their efforts.
“Well, the scripture says it’s a good thing to be used in a good cause,” Jackson said.
According to the biography on his campaign website , Jackson first moved to Boston with his wife, Theodora, in 1971 as part of his service in the U.S. Marine Corps. He and his wife left the city in 1998, a decision that was partly motivated, by “their desire for an environment more compatible with their conservative and Christian values.”
Since he was nominated to run in the gubernatorial race alongside Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli over the weekend, Jackson has drawn widespread attention for his past comments criticizing gays . He accused President Barack Obama of harboring “Muslim sensibilities.” and A video he once filmed compared Planned Parenthood to the KKK.
Jackson and the Cuccinelli campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

By William Peacock, Esq. on March 20, 2013 11:50 AM
"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich." Sounds like two Guinnesses and something made out of chicken, doesn't it? It's making us hungry.
It's not food and drink, however. It's a complicated corporate tax loophole, exploited by tech companies and others with intellectual property, pioneered by Apple, and used by many to save billions of dollars in taxes.
It all begins with the licensing of patents and IP to an Irish subsidiary. When products are sold in the U.S., taxes are reduced by paying royalties to that subsidiary. Under Irish law, if the subsidiary is managed by foreigners, profits skip along, Irish tax-free, usually to a Caribbean tax haven.
When products are sold outside of the U.S., profits are directed to another Irish subsidiary, who forwards the profits to the Netherlands under a tax-free treaty, which kicks the profits back to the initial Irish subsidiary, which exploits the same foreign-manager tax loophole to send money to the Caribbean.
Confused yet? Here's a pretty diagram , courtesy of the New York Times.
(Apple's innovations go far beyond the iPhone, don't they?)
Your first question: Is this all legal? It better be, as a number of tech companies are doing it, including Amazon and Google , reports CNBC.
Then again, not all of them are succeeding. The problem comes down to the value of that intellectual property, or " transfer pricing ." How much is a patent worth? When a company is licensing patents to itself, it's going to be tempted to set the value to the amount that will best benefit itself tax-wise. (Higher valuation means larger business expense deduction.)
Instead, companies are supposed to determine prices at "arm's length", meaning whatever price would be appropriate if they weren't licensing to themselves.
Inappropriate transfer pricing does come back to haunt some companies. In December, the Internal Revenue Service went after Amazon for $234 million in back taxes , claiming over-valuation of IP. Of course, the IRS is not always successful. They famously lost a similar case against Veritas Software (now part of Symantec) in 2010.
With all of that said, should you advise your company to take the same route? The savings don't lie: One study estimates that Apple saved between $2.4 and $4.8 billion in taxes . Just be sure that your transfer pricing is reasonable. (And if you aren't a tax lawyer, it's time to consult outside counsel.)

The landmark legislation easily passed the Judiciary Committee, giving reform its best chance in six years on the Senate floor. Yet even if the bill clears the Senate, the GOP-controlled House isn’t likely to take it up in its current form.
( PHOTOS: At a glance: The Senate immigration deal )
The vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments. But the Gang of Eight, which drafted the legislation, held together and fended off all but minor changes to the bill.
“This is a big step forward,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Gang. “We got a good vote in committee, we expanded our little group to another vote, and the feeling is very strong here. I think we gained some momentum today. I really do.”
Schumer and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters that they remained hopeful that the bill could pick up 70 votes on the Senate floor.
“I think it’s possible,” said Flake, another Gang member. “We got a lot of hard work to do. A lot of hard work.”
The committee room, which was packed with reform proponents, erupted in applause and cheers of “Yes, we can” after the final vote. Democratic senators posed for pictures with supporters and received a succession of high fives and hugs.
President Barack Obama issued a statement congratulating the committee and urging the Senate to take up the bill “at the earliest possible opportunity.”
( Also on POLITICO: House immigration talks hang on health care )
“The process for considering this legislation has been open and inclusive with multiple hearings, and more than a hundred amendments were considered and adopted, in many cases with bipartisan support,” Obama said. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I , but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”
Senate leaders hope to begin considering the bill following the Memorial Day recess in June. That prospect got a boost on Tuesday when Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would not block debate from starting on the floor.
House leaders want their members to put forward their own version of immigration reform, which will be more conservative than the Senate bill. A bipartisan group of House negotiators announced an agreement last week on reform principles, but the lawmakers are struggling to finalize the deal.

http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-predictable-failure-of-fiscal-austerity-by-robert-skidelsky|Austere Illusions
LONDON – The doctrine of imposing present pain for future benefit has a long history – stretching all the way back to Adam Smith and his praise of “parsimony.” It is particularly vociferous in “hard times.” In 1930, US President Herbert Hoover was advised by his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system...People will...live a more moral life...and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.”
To “liquidationists” of Mellon’s ilk, the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking, in housing, in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored. Their position is clear: the state is a parasite, sucking the lifeblood of free enterprise. Economies gravitate naturally to a full-employment equilibrium, and, after a shock, do so fairly quickly if not impeded by misguided government action. This is why they are fierce opponents of Keynesian interventionism.
Keynes’s heresy was to deny that there are any such natural forces, at least in the short term. This was the point of his famous remark, “In the long run we are all dead.” Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time. To believe otherwise is to commit the “fallacy of composition.” What is true of the parts is not true of the whole. If all of Europe is cutting, the United Kingdom cannot grow; if the entire world is cutting, global growth will stop.
In these circumstances, austerity is exactly the opposite of what is needed. A government cannot liquidate its deficit if the source of its revenues, the national income, is diminishing. It is deficit reduction, not debt, that is profligate, because it implies wastage of available human and physical capital, quite apart from the resulting misery.
Austerity’s advocates rely on one – and only one – argument: If fiscal contraction is part of a credible “consolidation” program aimed at permanently reducing the share of government in GDP, business expectations will be so encouraged by the prospect of lower taxes and higher profits that the resulting economic expansion will more than offset the contraction in demand caused by cuts in public spending. The economist Paul Krugman calls this the “confidence fairy.”
The pro-austerity argument is pure assertion, but it is meant to be a testable assertion, so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends, the faster the economy will grow. Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
Economists arrived at some striking correlations. For example , “an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a 0.5-1% lower annual growth rate.” In April 2010, the leader of this school, Harvard University’s Alberto Alesina, assured European finance ministers that “even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run.”
But two fallacies vitiated the “proofs” offered by Alesina and others. First, because the cuts had to be “credible” – that is, large and decisive – the continuing absence of growth could be blamed on the insufficiency of the cuts. Thus, Europe’s failure to recover “immediately” has been due to a lack of austerity, even though public-sector retrenchment has been unprecedented.
Second, the researchers committed the arch-statistical mistake of confusing correlation with causation. If you find a correlation between deficit reduction and growth, the reduction could be causing the growth or vice versa. (Or both the deficit reduction and the growth could be due to something else – devaluation or higher exports, for example.)
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end. Going through the same material as Alesina had, its authors pointed out that “while it is plausible to conjecture that confidence effects have been at play in our sample of consolidations, during downturns they do not seem to have ever been strong enough to make the consolidations expansionary.” Fiscal contraction is contractionary, period.
An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%. This finding reflected the massive overweighting of one country in their sample, and there was the same confusion between correlation and causation seen in Alesina’s work: high debt levels may cause a lack of growth, or a lack of growth may cause high debt levels.
On this foundation of zombie economics and slipshod research rests the case for austerity. In fact, the austerity boosters in the UK and Europe frequently cited the Alesina and Reinhart/Rogoff findings.
The results of austerity have been what any Keynesian would have expected: hardly any growth in the UK and the eurozone in the last two and a half years, and huge declines in some countries; little reduction in public deficits, despite large spending cuts; and higher national debts.
Two other consequences of austerity are less appreciated. First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed. Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
So we will remain in a state of “under-employment equilibrium” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed (and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse). In the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely, statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice.

Security Trumps Justice in Upcoming Manning Trial
As the pretrial concludes, 'Aiding the Enemy' charge stands while prosecutors drop 'Reykjavik-13'
- Lauren McCauley, staff writer
Tuesday marked the final day in pretrial hearings in the court martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning. (Credit: Reuters)Prosecutors will proceed with the charge that Pfc. Bradley Manning "aided the enemy" when the trial of the alleged whistleblower commences next week.
Tuesday marked the final day of pretrial hearings in the court martial of Manning during which attorneys for both sides and Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over the trial, issued a series of revisions for the upcoming trial.
During the hearing, Manning accepted as a "stipulation of fact" that the government has evidence that Osama Bin Laden had taken a "close personal interest" in the WikiLeaks materials. This "fact" was illustrated through a series of letters between Bin Laden and a member of al-Qaida—one of which included the Afghanistan "war logs" that were among the WikiLeaks disclosures.
Further, Lind issued a ruling Tuesday that the prosecution could use classified documents "within limits" to attempt to prove that the material Manning transmitted to WikiLeaks was potentially damaging to US interests.
The issue on how best to handle classified information throughout the trial has spurred some debate and prompted a " dry run " session after which Lind concluded it was "not possible to elicit coherently nuanced" testimony on classified information in open court and thus decided to close portions of the trial, independent blogger Kevin Gosztola reports.
"The over-riding interest in protecting national security over-rides the risk of miscarriage of justice," said Lind, who also added that it over-rode Manning's First Amendment rights.
Most notably, during Tuesday's proceedings military lawyers announced they were dropping one of the charges against him and would no longer seek to prove the US soldier was guilty of leaking the state department cable, known as "Reykjavik-13," which reportedly demonstrates the US's "bullying tactics against Iceland to accept austerity measures in the wake of the global financial meltdown."
The Guardian's Ed Pilkington reports:
[Manning] has pleaded guilty to a lesser offence relating to the leak of Reykjavik-13 and liable to a maximum of two years. The US government had sought to press further statutory charges on him that would have added up to an additional eight years on his sentence, but has now dropped the count.
However, the change may be "limited in significance," Pilkington adds, in light of the more serious accusation of "aiding the enemy." If Manning is found guilty of "assisting Osama bin Laden by making public information that could injure the US," he faces a potential life sentence with no chance of parole.
Pilkington continues: 
Should Manning be found not guilty to having aided the enemy, he still faces a further 20 counts carrying an overall maximum sentence of more than 150 years. At a minimum, the soldier has already pleaded guilty to lesser charges, of prejudicing the good order and discipline of the military by leaking information, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
The trial, which begins on June 3, will be the most high-profile prosecution by the Obama administration of a leak of state secrets. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has authorized more prosecutions of whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined.

Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports .
Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. "She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course," the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times .
Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would "have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."
The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question .
Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.
Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name "tea party" or "patriot."
According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration , Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.
Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave "false or misleading information" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.
"The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions," Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. "Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing -- the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs."

"This is pretty straightforward," Obama said at a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/obama-irs-scandal_n_3266577.html" target="_blank">press conference</a>. "If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way.

This direct assault on our Constitution further justifies the American people’s distrust in government and its ability to properly implement our laws." (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio)
"The admission by the Obama administration that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political opponents echoes some of the most shameful abuses of government power in 20th-century American history.  Today, we are left with serious questions: who is ultimately responsible for this travesty?  What actions will the Obama administration take to hold them accountable?  And have other federal agencies used government powers to attack Americans for partisan reasons?  House Republicans have made oversight of federal agencies a top priority on behalf of the American people, and I applaud the work that members such as Charles Boustany, Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan have done to bring this issue to light. I also strongly support Sen. McConnell’s call for a transparent, government-wide review to ensure similar practices are not happening elsewhere in the federal bureaucracy," Boehner said in a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-statement-irs-targeting-conservative-groups" target="_blank">statement</a>.

http://truth-out.org/news/item/16494-pbs-killed-wisconsin-uprising-documentary-citizen-koch-to-appease-koch-brothers|PBS Killed Wisconsin Uprising Documentary "Citizen Koch" To Appease Koch Brothers
Tuesday, 21 May 2013 09:19 By Brendan Fischer , PRWatch | Report
Email
(Photo: Elsewhere Films)"Citizen Koch," a documentary about money in politics focused on the Wisconsin uprising, was shunned by PBS for fear of offending billionaire industrialist David Koch, who has given $23 million to public television, according to  Jane Mayer of the  New Yorker . The dispute highlights the increasing role of private money in "public" television and raises even further concerns about the Kochs potentially purchasing eight major daily newspapers.
The film from Academy Award-nominated filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin documents how the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision helped pave the way for secret political spending by players like the Kochs,  who contributed directly and indirectly  to the election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in 2010 and  came to his aid again  when the battle broke out over his effort to limit collective bargaining. 
Originally slated to appear on PBS stations nationwide as part of the "Independent Lens" series, "Citizen Koch" had its funding pulled after David Koch was offended by another PBS documentary critical of the billionaire industrialists.
"People like the Kochs have worked for decades to undermine public funding for institutions like PBS," Deal told the Center for Media and Democracy. "When public dollars dry up, private dollars come in to make up for the shortfall."
And that private funding can conflict with PBS' "public" mission and its editorial integrity. The PBS distributor "backed out of the partnership because they came to fear the reaction our film would provoke," Deal and Lessin said in a statement. "David Koch, whose political activities are featured in the film, happens to be a public-television funder and a trustee of both [New York PBS member station] WNET and [Boston member station] WGBH. This wasn’t a failed negotiation or a divergence of visions; it was censorship, pure and simple.”
"Park Avenue" Documentary Raised Koch Hackles
In November of last year, the New York PBS affiliate WNET aired a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney, "Park Avenue," that explored growing income inequality by contrasting the lives of residents in a luxury apartment building in Manhattan with individuals living on the other end of Park Avenue, in the Bronx. The film focuses on one of the apartment's wealthiest residents, David Koch, and does not paint a particularly positive image of the billionaire industrialist and his brother, Charles.
Koch is also a board trustee and major donor to WNET. And WNET's president called him before the documentary aired to alert Koch to the critical content -- and took the nearly unprecedented step of airing a disclaimer from Koch following the film calling it "disappointing and divisive." WNET also replaced the original introduction to the film, which had been narrated by actor Stanley Tucci, with one calling the film "controversial" and "provocative." 
“They tried to undercut the credibility of the film, and I had no opportunity to defend it,” the film's director Gibney told Mayer. "Why is WNET offering Mr. Koch special favors?"
Independent Television Service (ITVS), an arm of PBS that funds and distributes independent films, had funded "Park Avenue," and aired it as part of ITVS' popular "Independent Lens" series that runs on dozens of PBS member stations. ITVS also funded "Citizen Koch" and it was also slated to be aired on the Independent Lens series. 
But "Citizen Koch" got caught in the blowback.
Fearing Koch Backlash, Funding Pulled on "Citizen Koch"
ITVS was excited about the "Citizen Koch" documentary before "Park Avenue" aired. In April 2012, the company informed Deal and Lessin their film would receive $150,000, and that “Everyone here at ITVS looks forward to working with you on your very exciting and promising program.”
But once "Park Avenue" aired, WNET blamed ITVS for impacting its relationship with David Koch and not providing advance notice of the film's contents. Mayer writes: 
"[WNET President Neal] Shapiro acknowledged that, in his conversations with ITVS officials about 'Park Avenue,' he was so livid that he threatened not to carry its films in the future. The New York metropolitan area is the largest audience for public television, so the threat posed a potentially mortal blow to ITVS."
ITVS got the message, and quickly changed its tune on "Citizen Koch."
Lessin and Deal began receiving pressure from ITVS executives to change the title and de-emphasize the Kochs' political influence. One executive told the filmmakers the title was "extremely problematic" and that “we live in a world where we have to be aware that people with power have power.”
On a conference call in January, ITVS executives acknowledged the push-back from WNET over the "Park Avenue" film, and again urged the filmmakers to change the storyline. Sources told Mayer that what their message was "Get rid of the Koch story line ... Because of the whole thing with the Koch brothers, ITVS knew WNET would never air it."
"It is always a struggle for documentaries to get out there," Deal told CMD. "That's why PBS and ITVS are so important: they support independent filmmakers to say new things on the public airwaves." But because of funding pressures, "we won't have access to that audience now," he said. "We're disappointed."
PBS Reaction to "Citizen Koch" Proved the Film's Point: Money Talks
"Citizen Koch," which premiered at Sundance in January and competed for Best Documentary, followed the activism and struggles of former Republicans who felt betrayed by Walker's union-busting move (which he never mentioned on the campaign trail). The film documents the role of Koch-funded entities like Americans for Prosperity, which spent  $10 million  aiding Walker in his recall election. The film's final scene shows an Americans for Prosperity official making the incredible claim the group is "just like the Red Cross, just like any other nonprofit.”
In April of this year, one day after the film had its Dairy State premiere at the Wisconsin Film Festival, ITVS informed Lessin and Deal it had "decided not to move forward with the project."
In a statement, the filmmakers said this is an ironic turn: “It’s the very thing our film is about—public servants bowing to pressures, direct or indirect, from high-dollar donors.”
"I don't believe there was a concerted conspiracy to keep 'Citizen Koch' off of public television, with David Koch as a ringleader," Deal told CMD. "Instead, Koch's presence and role in that world created an environment that was hostile to our message. And that was enough." 
Just before Mayer's New Yorker article was published, on May 16, David Koch resigned from WNET's board. The resignation was the result, a source told Mayer, "of his unwillingness to back a media organization that had so unsparingly covered its sponsor."
As has been widely reported , the Kochs are now considering a purchase of eight major daily newspapers currently owned by the Tribune Companies. And that has Deal worried. 
"For anybody who says the owner or funder of an outlet doesn't have an impact on what gets published, I hope they'll think again."

http://www.realfarmacy.com/monsanto-found-guilty-of-chemical-poisoning-in-landmark-case1/|Comments
A French farmer who can no longer perform his routine farming duties because of permanent pesticide injuries has had his day in court, literally, and the perpetrator of his injuries found guilty of chemical poisoning. The French court in Lyon ruled that Monsanto’s Lasso weedkiller formula, which contains the active ingredient alachlor, caused Paul Francois to develop lifelong neurological damage that manifests as persistent memory loss, headaches, and stuttering during speech.
Reports indicate that the 47-year-old farmer sued Monsanto back in 2004 after inhaling the Lasso product while cleaning his sprayer tank equipment. Not long after, Francois began experiencing lasting symptoms that prevented him from working, which he says were directly linked to exposure to the chemical. Since Lasso’s packaging did not bear adequate warnings about the dangers of exposure, Francois alleged at the time that Monsanto was essentially negligent in providing adequate protection for its customers.
To the surprise of many, the French court agreed with the claims and evidence presented before it, declaring earlier this year that “Monsanto is responsible for Paul Francois’ suffering after he inhaled the Lasso product … and must entirely compensate him.” The court is said to be seeking expert opinion on how to gauge Francois’ losses in order to determine precisely how much Monsanto will be required to compensate him in the case.
“It is a historic decision in so far as it is the first time that a (pesticide) maker is found guilty of such a poisoning,” said Francois Lafforgue, Paul Francois’ lawyer, to Reuters earlier in the year.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to alachlor can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, spleen, and eyes, and may lead to the development of anemia and even cancer. The EPA apparently views alachlor as so dangerous, in fact, that the agency has set the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) for alachlor to zero in order to “prevent potential health problems.” ( http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/alachlor.cfm )
In 2007, France officially banned Lasso from use in the country in accordance with a European Union (EU) directive enacted in 2006 prohibiting the chemical from further use on crops in any member countries. But despite all the evidence proving that alachlor can disrupt hormonal balance, induce reproductive or developmental problems, and cause cancer, the chemical is still being used on conventional crops throughout the U.S. to this very day. ( http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_ChemReg.jsp?Rec_Id=PC35160 )
“I am alive today, but part of the farming population is going to be sacrificed and is going to die because of (alachlor),” added Francois to Reuters.

http://www.laramieboomerang.com/articles/2013/05/15/news/doc519303f6ba00d303141049.txt|Next court date set in UW Crushes case
By JOSHUA ROBERTS / joshr@laramieboomerang.com  Wednesday, May 15, 2013
Share
A Laramie woman’s appearance Monday morning in Albany County Circuit Court didn’t take place as previously scheduled.
Meg Lanker-Simons, cited for interfering with a peace officer in connection with a social media controversy last month, is next set for a scheduling conference at 8:30 a.m. June 13 in Circuit Court.
Her attorney, Charles Pelkey, entered an appearance on her behalf and a not guilty plea in late April to the misdemeanor charge.
The charge stems from a UW Police investigation into a graphic, sexually-threatening comment posted on the Facebook page, UW Crushes.
Lanker-Simons was allegedly targeted in the comment. However, UW Police allege Lanker-Simons authored the comment.
“Subject admitted to making a controversial post on UW Crushes webpage and then lied about not doing it,” according to the citation.
The interference charge isn’t Lanker-Simons’ first experience with the local court system.
Documents outline radio station incident
According to court records, she was charged in November 2005 in District Court with aggravated assault. 
Lanker-Simons, then Meghan Michelena, pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2006 as part of a plea agreement, records indicate.
According to an affidavit, the charge stemmed from an incident in which Lanker-Simons walked into an Albany County radio station she’d been fired from with a Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun.
She confronted a man who had decided to terminate her, the affidavit reports. The man also told her, the court documents state, that she would not be rehired.
Lanker-Simons “pulled a semi-automatic pistol from her purse, waved the firearm around and pointed (the) firearm at (the man),” according to the affidavit.
The man, according to the affidavit, said he was “in fear for his life.” 
The radio station, the affidavit states, was evacuated.
Albany County Sheriff’s Office deputies made contact with Lanker-Simons as she was attempting to leave the area in her vehicle and detained her at gunpoint.
During an interview with deputies, Lanker-Simons “admitted to having (a) gun in (her) purse and pulling it out and waving it around (the) victim,” according to the affidavit.
She was sentenced to six years of probation in July 2006. 
The probation sentence was subject to numerous stipulations, including refraining from owning firearms, undergoing counseling, paying fines and fees, completing community service and submitting letters of apology to victims.
Later in 2006, she pleaded no contest to an attempt to revoke her probation. 
Court documents state she violated probation by being “unsuccessfully discharged” from a residential treatment program.
In April 2007, she was again sentenced to probation with the stipulation she complete a treatment program in Utah.
Web page removed
Last week, an online page at www.wepay.com seeking donations for Lanker-Simons’ medical expenses was removed.
On the page, she wrote she was seeking “donations because emergency surgery to remove an appendix time bomb has left our budget stretched beyond the breaking point,” according to a narrative explaining the monetary request.
“We’re finding it impossible to cover medical bills, pay rent and utilities, buy groceries and though I’ve been looking for full-time work, it’s been difficult to find anyone who’s even hiring. My husband and I are both working and going to school, but it’s just not enough.”
Since she was cited in the UW Crushes controversy, Lanker-Simons has referred questions to her attorney.
Pelkey said the wepay.com request was posted in February and gained recent attention because of a right-wing blog.
“Certainly this case has gotten a lot of attention, and there are a lot of people with a lot of opinions on both sides,” he said last week. “And, I would imagine there are people out there who believe Ms. Lanker did what she’s accused of doing and disagree with her politics.
“The assertion is she’s using it to raise money for her defense fund and fraudulently claiming that she needs a procedure. She did need the medical procedure, she got the medical procedure (and) she used funds because she’s a low-income person and got assistance.”
The wepay.com page had raised at least $2,400 before it was taken down.
Pelkey said his client has a full accounting of the donations and receipts for her medical expenses.
“We’re all in the position of having major expenses, really, for a major medical condition and she came up with a unique way of raising funds for it,” he said.
“Basically, her life has always been an open book online.”
Lanker-Simons, according to UW, participated Saturday in the College of Arts and Sciences’ commencement ceremony. 
She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Police Tase Foreclosed Upon Homeowners Protesting Criminal Bankers, Criminal Bankers Continue Facing No Repercussions
Why shoot peaceful protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant?
Taser International's X2 two-shot Taser for law enforcement is displayed in January. The US Supreme Court refused to review the use of Taser stun guns by police on two women, including one who was seven months pregnant at the time.
May 21, 2013  |  
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
 
You may have heard about the protests at the DOJ by foreclosed upon homeowners demanding that Eric Holder prosecute some bankers for their criminal activity. If you haven't,  you can read all about it here.  
Unfortunately, I received reports last night that citizens exercising their right to peacefully protest were being casually tasered by the authorities. 
This came from my friend Jason Rosenbaum, who was there:
At the start of the action, when the protesters and homeowners arrived at the south entrance of the DOJ, we were greeted by half a dozen police in tactical gear or uniforms and a metal barrier cutting off access to a small courtyard in front of the large DOJ doors. The group of protesters rallied at the barrier and the planters next to it that made up the square and homeowners slowly climbed over the barriers in an attempt to gain an audience at the DOJ and register their complaints. At that point, the police were keeping people from climbing over, but eventually the police retreated and a few homeowners and protesters made it over and sat down to occupy that space. More joined them. After about 10 minutes, as more climbed over the barrier and the crowd occupied more space, the police retreated up the few steps leading to the door, and eventually ceded the square entirely by going inside the DOJ, leaving the protesters and homeowners alone in the square. The protesters took down the barriers at that point and everyone occupied the square, complete with signs, chants, couches, tents, and the like. (There's video/photos of this on my Twitter feed, @j_ro.)
That was phase one -- for the next phase, the protest split into three groups, with one staying at the south entrance and the two others to take entrances on the north and west sides of the building. I went with the group going to the west, and we were met again by police presence at the west entrance. We pushed on through to the north entrance around the block, and again were met by police. After sitting down there for a bit and taking the intersection down the block, we were notified that our brethren needed our help back at the south entrance and we marched over.
When I got there with the crowd in my group, the police had about a dozen homeowners in plastic cuffs on the south steps and had set up a police line around the original square in front of the door. The people in my group rushed through the line to sit down with their fellow protesters and homeowners being arrested, and it was at this point that at least one officer took out his taser gun, pulled the trigger, and started using it to push back those in the crowd coming to the support of those being arrested. That's what you see in my video. As Matt noted, it was over very quickly, with protesters looking to peacefully support those who were being arrested being tased and pushed back, and those being arrested led into a police van and driven away for processing.
At this point, as the arrests were being loaded into the van, another group of about a dozen sat down inside the police barrier and as far as I know they're still there (I had to leave about an hour after the initial arrests). So there may be more arrests to come shortly.
There is nothing new about protesters gathering at government buildings. And it has never been a problem for the police to arrest protesters in an orderly fashion, even when the protesters are not cooperating by sitting down and refusing to move. This is the way civil disobedience has worked for many a moon. 
Shooting protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant, however, is new. And it's completely unnecessary, not to mention contrary to our long tradition of peaceful protest. I thought this sort of thing went out with the use of firehoses and police dogs.
It happened again today, this time well captured on video:
 
Note the casual sadism. The young woman is surrounded by three men as she links arms with another protester. She does not appear to be in any way violent or threatening. The big man behind her holds her around the neck and whispers in her ear (who knows what he told her, but if it's the usual, he says "cooperate right now or you're going to be tased.") As a peaceful protester engaged in civil disobedience she naturally refuses. At this point, they would normally pick her up bodily and carry her to the paddy wagon. Instead, they hit her with 50,000 volts of electricity, she crumbles to the ground as her whole body is overwhelmed by pain. 
And then they blithely walk away, leaving her writhing on the ground. Let's just say they were lucky she wasn't one of the thousands of people who've died from tasers. I guess they would have noticed at some point when she stopped screaming. 
This makes me sick to my stomach. And that it happened on the steps of the United States Department of Justice makes me ashamed to be an American. 
The woman who was tasered is named Carmen Pittman.  Here's her story.  I guess she just hasn't been punished enough.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Patrick Leahy withdrew his proposed amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have recognized the marriages of same-sex couples for immigration purposes on Tuesday night, after several Democratic members of the committee stated that they would not be supporting it.
A little past 7 p.m., Leahy said, “It is with a heavy heart … I will withhold the Leahy Amendment 7 at this point.”
Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offered the amendment a half-hour earlier, saying, “I don’t want to be the senator who asks Americans to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country.”
He added, “Discriminating against people based on who they love is a travesty,” noting that he wanted to hear from members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators about why they didn’t include protections for gay couples in the initial bill.
Sen. Lindsey Graham went first, saying he opposed the inclusion of gay couples’ protections in the bill, despite noting his respect for Leahy’s “passion” is support of marriage equality.
“If you redefine marriage for immigration purposes [by the amendment], the bill would fall apart because the coalition would fall apart,” Graham said. “It would be a bridge too far.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein cited Graham’s comments, then, saying of Leahy’s amendment, “I think this sounds like the fairest approach, but here’s the problem … we know this is going to blow the agreement apart. I don’t want to blow this bill apart.”
She cited the fact that the Supreme Court could strike down the Defense of Marriage Act provision that prevents same-sex couples from having equal immigration rights in coming months. She also noted the a bill she is sponsoring to repeal DOMA is holding in the Senate, concluding, “I would just implore to hold up on this amendment at this time.”
Sen. Jeff Flake, another Republican in the Gang of Eight, said, “It certainly would mean this bill would not move forward.”
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic member of the Gang of Eight, then spoke up, praising Leahy’s leadership, but concluding, “I believe that this is the wrong moment, this is the wrong bill.”
Sen. Chuck Schumer went last of the four members of the Gang of Eight on the committee, saying, “This is one of the most excruciating decisions I have had to make in my [time] in Congress. … Not to do this is rank discrimination.”
He then said, however, of opponents of inclusion, “They’ve made it perfectly clear that if this provision is included … they will abandon [the bill.] … If we make the effort to add it to this bill, they will walk away. … The result: no equality, no immigration bill, everyone loses. … Much as it pains me, I cannot support this amendment if it will bring down the bill.’
“I will be here,” Schumer said to the LGBT community, to work on the issue in the future. “This is far from our last battle together.”
Sen. Al Franken, likewise, joined in the decision not to support the amendment, saying, “This is the definition of a Hobson’s choice. … It’s wrong to discriminate against people, but I do not want the LGBT people who would be hurt by this bill not passing, this whole bill not passing, to be hurt by this falling apart.”

2013-05-20T22:00:02Z
There is no standard definition of the all-important term “wing nut,” so let’s provide one. A wing nut is someone who has a dogmatic commitment to an extreme political view (“wing”) that is false and at least a bit crazy (“nut”).
A wing nut might believe that George W. Bush is a fascist, that Barack Obama is a socialist, that big banks run the Department of the Treasury or that the U.S. intervened in Libya because of oil.
When wing nuts encounter people with whom they disagree, they immediately impugn their opponents’ motivations. Whatever their religion, they are devout Manicheans, dividing their fellow citizens into the forces of light and the forces of darkness.
Wing nuts have a lot of fellow travelers -- people who don’t fit the definition, yet who are similarly dogmatic and whose views, though not really crazy, aren’t exactly evidence-based. You can be a wing nut on a particular issue without being a wing nut in general. Most human beings can hear the voice, at least on occasion, of their inner wing nut.
The good news is that wing nuts usually don’t matter. The bad news is that they influence people who do. Sadly, more information often fails to correct people’s misunderstandings. In fact, it can backfire and entrench them. Can anything be done?
Stunning Conclusion
For a positive answer, consider an intriguing study by Philip Fernbach, a University of Colorado business school professor, and his colleagues. Their central finding is that if you ask people to explain exactly why they think as they do, they discover how much they don’t know -- and they become more humble and therefore more moderate.
The study came in four stages. First, people were asked to state their positions on a series of political issues, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, a national flat tax, merit-based pay for teachers and unilateral sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. They were asked to describe their position on a seven-point scale whose endpoints were “strongly in favor” and “strongly opposed.”
Second, people were asked to rate their degree of understanding of each issue on a seven-point scale. The third step was the crucial one; they were asked to “describe all the details you know about [for example, the impact of instituting a ‘cap and trade’ system for carbon emissions ], going from the first step to the last, and providing the causal connection between the steps.” Fourth, people were asked to rerate their understanding on the seven-point scale and to restate their position on the relevant issue.
The results were stunning. On every issue, the result of requesting an explanation was to persuade people to give a lower rating of their own understanding -- and to offer a more moderate view on each issue. In a follow-up experiment, Fernbach and his co-authors found that after being asked to explain their views, people were less likely to want to give a bonus payment to a relevant advocacy group.
Interestingly, Fernbach and his co-authors found no increase in moderation when they asked people not to “describe all the details you know” about the likely effects of the various proposals, but simply to say why they believe what they do. If you ask people to give reasons for their beliefs, they tend to act as their own lawyers or public relations managers, and they don’t move toward greater moderation. The lesson is subtle: What produces an increase in humility, and hence moderation, is a request for an explanation of the causal mechanisms that underlie people’s beliefs.
Motivated Reasoning
In an unnoticed essay, the economist Albert Hirschman lamented the “overproduction of opinionated opinion.” He feared that strong opinions, as such, “might be dangerous to the health of our democracy,” because they can make it harder for people to understand one another and to find mutually agreeable solutions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are to be believed, the problem is curable -- at least if those who have “opinionated opinions” have less than solid foundations for their beliefs and if they can be convinced of that fact.
For wing nuts and their many fellow travelers, however, there is a serious obstacle, and it goes by the name of “motivated reasoning.” When people have a strong emotional attachment to their initial convictions, they tend to heap ridicule on anything that runs counter to those convictions and to give a lot of weight to anything that supports them.
Motivated reasoning helps to account for two defining characteristics of wing nuts and their fellow travelers: a readiness to attack people’s good faith, rather than their actual arguments, and an eagerness to make the worst, rather than the best, of opposing positions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are right, this obstacle may not be insuperable. Serious efforts to examine the assumptions behind your own beliefs, and to identify what you don’t know, are likely to produce an increase in humility. Whether or not you change your view, you may well be humbled -- and end up being a bit more charitable to those who see things differently.

WASHINGTON | Tue May 21, 2013 5:50pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid expressions of horror, grief and resolve over the devastating tornado that smashed into suburban Oklahoma City, many lawmakers expressed relief on Tuesday that they took action in January to bulk up the FEMA disaster relief fund.
But Oklahoma's two senators, both Republicans, found themselves in an awkward position for having voted against the $60 billion supplemental appropriation bill that was largely aimed at providing relief to victims of Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into coastal New York and New Jersey last year.
The bill left the disaster fund run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a healthy balance of $11.6 billion. FEMA spokesman Dan Watson said the amount is sufficient for handling immediate response and recovery efforts in Oklahoma and residual recovery costs associated with Sandy.
In January, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe called the Sandy appropriations bill a "slush fund" because it included long-term infrastructure spending and funding for projects aimed at disasters other than the devastation along the U.S. East Coast.
The measure became embroiled in a tense budget fight over the "fiscal cliff" tax hikes in January and was delayed for several weeks for tempers to cool as FEMA's disaster fund rapidly dwindled.
On Tuesday, a day after a 2-mile (3-km) -wide tornado wiped out whole blocks of homes, killed at least 24 people and left thousands homeless in Moore, Oklahoma, Inhofe vowed that Oklahomans in need would not abuse federal disaster aid, as he said had occurred in the aftermath of Sandy.
"That's totally different," Inhofe told cable TV network MSNBC. "Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in Oklahoma."
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who also opposed the Sandy appropriation because it was not offset with budget savings elsewhere, pledged to make a similar "pay-for" demand if further disaster funds were needed. For now, however, he was focused on getting aid to the victims.
"As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I can assure Oklahomans that any and all available aid will be delivered without delay," Coburn said in a statement.
Representative Tom Cole, the Republican congressman whose district bore the brunt of the tornado - its second major disaster due to a twister in 14 years - had no explaining to do. He supported the Sandy legislation and pledged whatever resources were necessary to recover and rebuild devastated communities.
Cole, a moderate Republican with a reputation as a pragmatist, earned notoriety during the budget talks late last year as the first member of his party to advocate allowing higher tax rates on the wealthy in order to prevent tax increases on the vast majority of Americans.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he also helped trim some provisions from the Sandy bill that were unrelated to that disaster.
"I am confident we will get the help we need to make it through this tragedy. That is what Americans do for other Americans in tough times and challenging circumstances," Cole said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski, also a Democrat, both pledged that if more money was needed for Oklahoma City, they would take action to fund it.
"This is a time for neighbor helping neighbor. This is not the time for a 'budgeteering' battle. This is a time to respond with compassion and competence," Mikulski of Maryland said in a statement.

Budget request calls for $200m to go towards military construction to upgrade temporary facilities at the prison.
Last Modified: 22 May 2013 00:07
Since his inauguration in January 2009, US President Barack Obama has pushed for shutting the prison [AFP]
The Pentagon is asking Congress for more than $450 million for maintaining and upgrading the Guantanamo Bay prison that President Barack Obama wants to close.
New details on the administration's budget request emerged on Tuesday and underscored the contradiction of the president waging a political fight to shutter the facility while the military calculates the financial requirements to keep the installation operating, AP news agency reported.
The budget request for the fiscal year beginning October 1 calls for $79m for detention operations, the same as the current year, and $20.5m for the office of military commissions, an increase over the current amount of $12.6m. The request also includes $40m for a fiber optic cable and $99 million for operation and maintenance.
The Pentagon also wants $200m for military construction to upgrade temporary facilities. That work could take eight to 10 years as the military has to transport workers to the island, rely on limited housing and fly in building material.
The facility at the US naval base in Cuba currently holds 166 prisoners, and hunger strikes by 100 of them over their indefinite detention and prison conditions prompted Obama to renew his effort to close Guantanamo.
'Not necessary'
The president is expected to discuss the future of the facility in a speech on counterterrorism on Thursday.
"Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe," the president said at a White House news conference last month. "It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."
Since his inauguration in January 2009, Obama has pushed for shutting the prison, signing an executive order for closure during his first week in office. He has faced resistance in Congress with Republicans and some Democrats repeatedly blocking efforts to transfer terror suspects to the United States.
The law that Congress passed and Obama signed in March to keep the government running includes a longstanding provision that prohibits any money for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States or its
territories. It also bars spending to overhaul any US facility in the US to house detainees.

Siena, Italy—Here’s a modest idea to break the gridlock, the stupidity, the meanness, the partisan lying and irresponsible ineffectiveness of modern Washington. We should consider returning to the Middle Ages.
Siena today is a small city of about 50,000 people, not much bigger than it was at its peak in the late 13th century. In those good and bad old days, it was a major manufacturing, mostly wool, and commercial center in Tuscany. The bad things were the Black Death—the plague of 1348, which wiped out more than its inhabitants, reducing it to a population that might have been as low as 16,000—and its repression by a larger neighbor, Florence. The good thing was that it was prevented from growing by those great troubles. Because of losing its struggles with its northern neighbor, much of Siena is still a beautiful and preserved city of the 14th century.
The other good and interesting thing about the city is how it was governed from 1277 to 1355. The largest building on the city’s spectacular oval Piazza del Campo, then and now, is the Palazzo Pubblico, were the city was governed by the "Nove," nine men selected by lottery and locked in the palace for two months at a time.
The idea: to keep away outsiders and outside influences—we call them special interests, lobbies and lawyers—as the "councillors" debated the problems and future of their city and then wrote its laws. The motives: to reduce the power of the Catholic Church, the richest institution in the area, and the power of aristocrats, members of the 56 families exercising military and commercial power.
One of the rooms in the palace, the "Sala della Pace," the room of peace, where the nine gathered, was decorated by murals—still visible today—showing dramatic instances of good and evil in government. The "Good Government" paintings show peace, prosperity and the virtues of Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, Prudence and Magnanimity—and, of course, Faith, Hope and Charity.

The "Bad Government" paintings show murder in the streets, soldiers carrying away women, and Justice bound in the chains of Tyranny.
Looked good to me. Unfortunately, the Council of Nine was overthrown by aristocrats and soldiers of Florence, who blamed the Nine for the plague destroying the city.
So where are we today in Washington? What will people hundreds of years from now think of our national governance with all its blaming, nastiness and negativity? It looks as if our country is being run by thugs and liars motivated by revenge and pettiness beyond description.
Our leaders are obsessed, it seems, with peripheral "scandals" and misjudgments, public relations arguments, talking points and plain old nonsense. A relevant critique of the current state of affairs in the IRS "scandal" was published a week or so ago by Michael Hiltzik, the economic columnist of the Los Angeles Times:
"It’s strange how ‘scandal’ gets defined these days in Washington. At the moment, everyone is screaming about the ‘scandal’ of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.
"Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.
"The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations."
I’m with him. Lock up the leaders of our Republic and force them to deal with real issues—and with each other.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/politics/anthony-weiner-mayoral-campaign/index.html|Disgraced ex-congressman Weiner says he's running for NYC mayor
From Alison Harding, CNN
updated 1:44 AM EDT, Wed May 22, 2013
(CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner is running for New York City mayor, he announced Wednesday morning in a video posted on his campaign website .
"Look, I've made some big mistakes and I know I've let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons," Weiner said in the video. "I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it for my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."
Weiner plotting a political comeback?
Now that Weiner is in the race, the Democrat will undoubtedly face questions from voters and fellow candidates about the 2011 scandal that eventually led to his resignation from Congress.
His political career was derailed after he was found sending lewd photos and messages to multiple women. At first he lied, claiming his Twitter was hacked, but he later admitted to the indiscretions and left the House of Representatives.

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/21/a-mileage-tax-for-all-n-j-drivers-with-help-from-big-brother-it-could-happen/|Separated At Birth
UNION, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — It’s a controversial proposal: Paying for every mile you drive to cover road repairs.
While some say it’s necessary, others are saying it’s time to put the brakes on the idea, CBS 2’s Christine Sloan reported Tuesday.
It’s the one thing New Jersey can boast about – having the fourth-lowest gas tax in the nation . The money goes into the state’s transportation trust fund, paying for roads and bridges.
But what if you learned the fund is $14.3 billion in debt, and the gas tax just covers a yearly $991 million debt payment?
“The problem there is because previous administrations and legislatures raided the transportation trust fund to use that money in general funds,” said Sal Risalvato of the New Jersey Gasoline Convenience Automotive Association .
It’s what prompted the bill to repeal the gas tax and have residents pay for every mile they drive, so cars that don’t use gasoline or get better mileage pay for roads, too.
“How are you going to track that?” one driver wondered.
It turns out, with a GPS device. The concern was about big brother watching, so after opposition, the sponsor of the legislation this week amended the bill to only tax electric and compressed natural gas-powered car owners with a yearly $50 fee.
“They’re using the same roads everyone else is so they should pay the same tax,” said Susan Berowitz of Mountainside.
“Why should they be penalized for helping the environment?” added Danielle Morse of Union.
The Sierra Club agrees, with director Jeff Tittel saying, “We try to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars but now this is a disincentive.”
He said raise the gas tax. But with federal incentives to make fuel-efficient cars, Risalvato said there could be a mileage tax.
“Someday this could be the means,” Risalvato said.
Risalvato said some insurance companies are using mileage tracking devices and car manufacturers could build them into cars.
The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Jim Whelan told CBS 2 that while he is for fuel-efficient cars, $50 isn’t much money when you can afford to buy a car that cost more than $40,000. Hybrid cars are exempt in his bill. Two other states have vehicle mileage tax laws, Washington and Virginia.

CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson said on Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been "compromised" for over two years.
Attkisson told a local Philadelphia radio station that she has been working with investigators to discover the source of the activity.
"There has been an issue in my house and there has been an issue with my computers that's gone on for quite a long time that we're looking into," she said.
Attkisson has long been a thorn in the side of the White House, and a hero to conservatives, for her aggressive reporting on the incident in Benghazi and on the "Fast and Furious" controversy.
In 2011, she made waves when she claimed that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting on "Fast and Furious."
Host Chris Stigall asked if Attkisson thought that she had been the victim of a government operation, as the Associated Press and Fox News' James Rosen were . Attkisson was careful not to make any specific allegations about who had been targeting her, but she said it was possible there was a connection.
"I think there could be some relationship between these types of things and what happened to me," she said, adding that something suspicious had been happening since "at least February of 2011 and I think probably a significant period of time before that."
UPDATE: A spokesperson for CBS News told HuffPost's Michael Calderone, "We are investigating the matter."

We produce enough of oil not to have to import it from other places. If you look at the cost of gas in top oil producing countries in the world they only pay a small fraction for oil compared to us. Of course we consume a lot more than then they do but the reason we pay so much more is because a large portion of oil that we produce is exported to other countries. Does that make any sense to you?﻿ OIl companies take American oil, sell it to other countries for big profit and then charge us more.

10 Amazing Charts That Demonstrate The Slow, Agonizing Death Of The American Worker
By Michael, on May 16th, 2013
The middle class American worker is in danger of becoming an endangered species.  The politicians are not telling you the truth, and the mainstream media is certainly not telling you the truth, but the reality is that there is nothing but bad news on the horizon for workers in the United States.  In the old days, when the big corporations that dominate our society did well, that also meant good things for American workers since those corporations would need more of us to work for them.  But in the emerging one world economic system that our economy is being merged into, those corporations have other choices now.  For instance, the big corporations can now choose to limit the number of "expensive" American workers that they employ by shipping millions of jobs to the other side of the world .  And from their perspective, it makes perfect sense.  They can make much bigger profits by hiring people on the other side of the planet to work for them for less than a dollar an hour.  If they can get good production out of those people, then why should they hire Americans for ten to twenty times as much, plus have to give those Americans health insurance and other benefits?  Another major factor in the slow, agonizing death of the American worker is technology.  We live during a period when technology is advancing at a pace that is almost unimaginable at the same time that it is steadily becoming cheaper and cheaper.  That means that it is going to become easier and easier for companies to replace workers with robots and computers.  As I have written about previously , it is being projected that our economy will lose millions of jobs to technology in the coming years.  Yes, some of us will still be needed to help build the robots and the computers, but not all of us will.  And of course the overall general weakness of the economy is not helping matters either.  The American people inherited the greatest economic machine in the history of the world, and we have wrecked it.  Decades of very foolish decisions have resulted in the period of steady economic decline that we are experiencing now.
America is simply not the economic powerhouse that it once was.  Back in 2001, the U.S. economy accounted for 31.8 percent of global GDP.  By 2011, the U.S. economy only accounted for 21.6 percent of global GDP.  That is a collapse any way that you want to look at it.
Today, American workers are living in an economy that is rapidly declining, and their jobs are steadily being stolen by robots, computers and foreign workers that live in countries where it is legal to pay slave labor wages.  Politicians from both political parties refuse to do anything to stop the bleeding because they think that the status quo is working just great.
So don't expect things to get better any time soon.
The following are 10 amazing charts that demonstrate the slow, agonizing death of the American worker...
#1 Wages And Salaries As A Percentage Of GDP
As you can see, wages as a percentage of GDP are hovering near an all-time record low.  That means that American workers are bringing home a smaller share of the economic pie than ever before.
#2 Average Annual Hours Worked Per Employed Person In The United States
We are an economy that is rapidly trading good paying full-time jobs for low paying part-time jobs.  The decline in average annual hours worked that we have witnessed represents the equivalent of losing millions of jobs.  There has been an explosion of " the working poor " in the United States, and this trend is probably only going to accelerate in the years to come.
#3 Manufacturing Employment
As you can see, there are less Americans working in manufacturing today than there was in 1950 even though the population of the country has more than doubled since then.  The United States has lost more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities since 2001, and yet our politicians stand around and do nothing about it.
#4 Employment-Population Ratio
This is one of my favorite charts.  It shows that there has been absolutely no employment recovery at all since the end of the last recession.  The percentage of working age Americans that have a job has stayed under 59 percent for 44 months in a row.  How much worse will things get when the next major economic downturn strikes?
#5 Labor Force Participation Rate
This is how the Obama administration is getting the "unemployment rate" to magically go down.  They are pretending that millions upon millions of Americans simply do not want to work anymore.  As you will notice, the decline of the labor force participation rate has accelerated greatly since Barack Obama entered the White House.
#6 Duration Of Unemployment
The average amount of time that it takes an unemployed worker to find a new job has declined slightly, but it is still far above normal historical levels.  It is a crying shame that it takes the average unemployed worker two-thirds of a year to find a new job, but this is the new economic reality that we are all living in.
#7 Delinquency Rate On Residential Mortgages
Since there are not enough jobs for all of us, and since our wages are not rising as rapidly as the cost of living is, a whole bunch of us are falling behind on our mortgages.  As you can see, the mortgage delinquency rate has only dropped slightly and is still way, way above typical levels.
#8 New Homes Sold
American workers also don't have enough money to go out and buy new homes either.  Yes, new home sales have rebounded slightly this year, but we are nowhere near where we used to be.
#9 Consumer Credit
Millions of American families continue to resort to going into debt in a desperate attempt to make ends meet.  After a slight interruption during the last recession, consumer credit once again is growing at a frightening pace.
#10 Self-Employment At A Record Low
Since there aren't enough jobs for everyone, why aren't more Americans trying to start their own businesses?  Well, the reality of the matter is that the government has made it exceedingly difficult to start your own business today.  Taxes, rules, regulations and red tape are choking the life out of millions of small businesses in the United States.  As a result, the percentage of self-employed Americans is at a record low .
As all of these long-term trends continue, the middle class will continue to shrink, poverty in America will continue to explode and government dependence will continue to rise.
The numbers don't lie.  Today, the number of Americans on Social Security Disability now exceeds the entire population of Greece , and the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the entire population of Spain .
We are in the midst of a horrifying economic collapse, and the next major wave of that collapse is rapidly approaching.
Are you ready?

You’d probably be too weak from starvation to escape. Just kidding. I don’t know if it will get to the point where we’re taken to internment camps. I certainly hope it doesn’t get that bad. But it has happened in past. There is a book that everyone should read. It’s called “The Real Lincoln: A Second Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda and an Unnecessary War” by Tom DiLorenzo. Lincoln actually had political opponents imprisoned. The book was a real eye-opener for me in that what I was taught in the public school system was mostly fiction.

Two more good books to read: “The Naked Capitalist,” by W. Cleon Skousen. (130 pages, a short commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley’s book  (1300 pages)”Tragedy and Hope. A History of The World In Our Time.”
The second book: “Fahrenheit 451″ by Ray Bradbury, another very short book.

This is your main problem I think: way too much fiction
dancingontheheadofapin
I don’t have a problem, “Your Mama.” If you know how to read, I would advise you to get your head out of the sand and read not only the books I listed, but also George Orwell’s “1984″ and “Behold A Pale Horse” by William Cooper.  Cooper was murdered for exposing the government by writing and publishing this book.  Do a search for William Cooper or go to You Tube to see some of his videos.  The two books I listed in my previous comment are short books, so for those with a short attention span they will be fine.  If you want to really understand what is going on read the two in this comment.  Orwell’s book was thought of as fiction when it was written because no one believed it could happen.  Do  yourself a favor and get educated.

Read not the written word of mankind??  What about the Bible??  If we do not know history, we are doomed to repeat it.  Before written history was oral history, which was handed down from generation to generation. Some of the books of the Bible were written many years after Christ left this earth.  Those histories were passed down.  How would anyone know about anything beyond their own sphere of existence of the nation and the world unless there was communication?  Observation is subjective as is most communication.  Learn from it and then make decisions based on common sense.

All it takes is for OPEC to dump the dollar for something else(petro-dollars) and its Game Over. China could trigger that very easily and simply: just plain stop buying our debt. This would cause inflation to more than likely start rising at an uncontrolled rate(not quite Hyper, but close), which would cause OPEC to start looking at something else, and then our problems would multiply as the rest of the world would then start buying oil with some other form of currency and the dollars start flying back home. I actually hope this happens, the sooner the better, as  it would usher in a real recovery sooner instead of this miserable existence that we live in now….
Midwesterner
I mostly agree with you except China has already stopped buying our debt, that is why the FED stepped in to buy it, no one else wants it. As far as consequences of OPEC exiting from the US Petro Dollar, absolutely correct but Iraq and Libya tried that and we know what happened to them. Iran sells its oil for gold, not Dollars, which puts them on the radar too. As long as the most powerful military in the world is backing the Petro Dollar, they will be able to keep the game going.
MeMadMax
Incorrect, china is still buying debt, they have to unless/until the yen gets a good foothold. The segment that has stopped buying our debt is the personal type, as in individuals/small groups and the like. Although you would be correct in saying the Fed is buying the bulk of the debt however. And the opec deal all falls on saudi arabia, I think they will  pull the trigger after they get a nuke. They are actively shopping for one(and not hiding it), along with Bahrain.

Contradiction. The increased number of women in the workforce quadrupled from the Rush Limbaugh era of the 1950s. A majority of middle class women are making more money than ever before in history, more women are in top position jobs and more women are enrolling in college.
The visible minorities are the marginalised groups, but affirmative action will increase the job prospects for the visible minorities in America.
Syrin
You’re kidding right?   You know WHY more women are in the work force?   Look at that graph showing wages.    They HAVE to be.   Affirmative Action is why we have the worst president in history occupying the WHite House.    Affirmative Action forces employers to hire unqualified people at above market salaries, and they can’t fire them because minorities are no longer protected classes, they are privileged.
Angela
That is racist. Diversity is our strength. Diversity is good. FYI, if it wasn’t for affirmative action, I would have been neglected for hiring. Because I am a girl, I face discrimination in the patriarchal society. Did you know that a woman earns 45% less than an average white man working the same job?
Syrin
Diversity is not good.   Multi-culturalism has proven to be a failed experiment leading to violence.
Read and learn.   Stop blaming men for your problems: “Generally, women value relationships more than their careers or money, enter and leave the work force at a much higher rate, work part-time at a much higher rate, and work in professions with much lower compensation. As he explains in his book,Why Men Earn More, nearly all of it boils down to differences in occupation, and men overwhelmingly dominate jobs that
are in an unpleasant environment (sanitation vs. child care)
require harder-to-attain skills (physics vs. philosophy)
require longer work hours
demand financial risk (entrepreneur vs. teaching)
are inconvenient (i.e., relocation)
are hazardous (construction vs. librarian)
Due to the simple laws of supply and demand, these occupations pay more and contribute immensely to the pay gap. But again, government statistics completely neglect occupation — making a raw comparison of all working men and women instead (e.g., the female receptionist is lumped in with the $21,000/hr Lebron James and little-guy Michael Moore).
Wage gap statistics also do not account for time commitment. On average, women work far less than men because they choose to have much more balance in their lives. A study by the Center for Policy Alternatives and Lifetime Television found that nearly 85 percent of women took advantage of flexible work arrangements offered by their employers. And a decade after graduating college, 39 percent of women leave the work force or work part-time, versus 3 percent of men. Aside from the obvious benefits of working longer, workers who average 44 or more hours per week earn approximately 100 percent more than workers who average 40 hours.”

Here’s an example of discrimination against a woman brought to you by the PC affirmative action police in Philadelphia. A trilingual college-educated Hispanic/Uruguayan woman I know applied for a job with the city, which was enthusiastic when they saw her Spanish name but quickly lost their enthusiasm when they saw  that she was a WHITE Hispanic woman. The idiot affirmative action Democraps couldn’t wrap their racist heads around the fact that a woman could be both white and Hispanic. She didn’t fit their narrow view of what a Hispanic woman is supposed to look like. So much for “diversity.”
Conclusion: some of the worst bigots are government Democraps who support affirmative action quotas.

45%? Perhaps in some instances but not as a whole. Refresh your research. And you only face discrimination in a patriarchal society because you believe you do.

wow…where did all these new people come from? Felicia, Tracy, you sound like you had just plagiarized a Sociology textbook. I think you are missing the whole point of this article (as well as the stats) in that our jobs and productivity have been shipped offshore and we are simply living on a falsely inflated economy and borrowed time. “Affirmative Action” is just so much more politically correct mumbo jumbo that actually punishes companies and employers rather than helping the marginalized in attaining opportunity. The problem with so many ideas set forth by….well, idealists–is that they SOUND all good but in all reality we DON’T live in a Utopian world; MLK’s dream is great for inspiration but the reality of such dreams will always fall short.
Tracy, you post about the future of our next generations being in the hands of todays girls (loose quote, sorry) is a scary and sobering thought. So many young people are caught up in what I call the “Matrix”, an unreal technological world unattached from down to Earth reality; a narcissistic generation that cannot live without constant input, affirmation, attention, etc. from their peers. So many  young people have NO real life skills WHATSOEVER. How IS this next generation going to function? Are they going to go to college, get a government job (pretty soon it looks like all jobs are going to be government jobs) pay other people to cook, clean, and raise their children? Already happening. I am almost 50 years old, I’ve seen a lot and the world change so very much in my life; but I can assure you the best thing you can give to your children/the next generation is STABILITY. Not a $400 phone, not the best day care ever, not the best labels out there, but the stability, love and encouragement of parents/caretakers that are totally committed to the upbringing of their young.

I’m not exactly a feminist, but I’m not patriarchal either. No particular bias,  my POV comes from real life and observation. Stats are just horrible for children raised in fatherless homes.
When our kids were young, we chose to live SIMPLY in order to give to them stability.
Roseof13
The mental, spiritual and emotional health of future generations is directly related to the amount of time, care and input they enjoy from wise women who understand that a woman does not need to compete with a man and raising a family is the highest art.
Equal does not mean same. We are not the same, but we are equal in terms of honour we deserve for doing that which is our main purpose and mission.
A full time mother is a physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, healer, artist, spiritual leader, etc, etc..
Opportunities for further learning and sharing abound in a women’s realm.
What happens to the children who are being raised by the internet, TV and their peers?
Are we better off after this drive for women to prove their equality by competing in the realm of career?
Men need to honor and respect our realm and both men and women need to come together and learn (or re-learn) how to have peace in our homes.
Craig
Good point Roseof13…..The economy is going down, jobs are being lost by the tens of thousands and the only solution given from these radical feminists is they should get jobs :-/ Radical feminists are a bunch of whining, entitled and spoiled women who can’t find a decent man and when the thugs and dunces wear out their bodies, the feminists spew hatred all over the place like the stuff squirted on their face in the rave parties.

But when their youth and looks gone are gone and they are 50 or 60 pounds overweight (all that boozing, binge eating and cigarette smoking takes it toll), they want a decent, responsible guy to support them financially. They go from spreading their legs for drug addicts and sociopaths to saying that they won’t date any guy who makes under 100K (as if a guy who makes that kind of money wants to date a frumpy, obese bitch in sweatpants).

You do realize that white women are minorities as well right? See, you’re the racist because you actually blame black people for something that white people created in the first place. Affirmative action benefited white women more so than black women and men. Also, affirmative action did not cause Obama to be president. Interesting, Obama is half white (bi-racial) and yet, you call him black. You don’t claim his white side from his mother. Interesting racist you are.

We are all of us, evil.
Eve was deceived but Adam disobedient.  Women can be saved from this stigma of leading the human race to sin and death, only through repentance in Christ,… and then even more hope for some of those sisters – rearing godly children in the Lord.
The fall came to mankind by Eve’s actions and so the Lord incarnates himself in the virgin Mary’s womb to make the ultimate sacrifice for sin – once and forever, but not for all sinners.
This incarnation of God to be the God Man, is Jesus, who came that he would destroy the works of the devil.
Sisters in the meetings of the saints are wearing head coverings  You don’t see the men complaining about that.
The man God created first then the woman, and she out from the man.  The woman was to help and be one with the man. Not the other way around.  The genders are different by design.  The order of creation is dripping with meaning.
In a godless society like ours, the culture wants to blur these distinctions in the name of worldly equality and pay.
Just remember – the female, the bible says, are more fragile and instructs Christian men to dwell with them in understanding.
Perfection is but a foretaste in this life but wait until His kingdom is manifested in all of it’s glory.

America is losing jobs and families are being destabilised because of the economy.
Feminists can no longer contribute anything meaningful to society. It’s like society rewards the deviant people and punish the ambitious Americans who uphold family values. I don’t mean to sound sexist or homophobic but the inconvenient truth is that someone in the upper echelons of politics and business is trying to destroy the family unit.

Fast and Furious/Benghazi investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson: Something fishy’s been going on with my computers since early 2011
posted at 10:41 am on May 21, 2013 by Allahpundit
Via the Chris Stigall Show and WPHT in Philadelphia. Two weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been worth posting; Attkisson herself, I suspect, wouldn’t have mentioned it publicly. Even if she’s right about something fishy going on, there are other plausible culprits besides the U.S. government when it comes to reporters’ computers being infiltrated. Two weeks later, though, knowing now that the DOJ was willing to order a dragnet of AP reporters’ phone records and actually read James Rosen’s e-mails, there’s no way around the obvious suspicion. If the feds were willing to monitor Rosen and the AP in the name of cracking down on leakers, why wouldn’t they monitor the one reporter from non-Fox big media who’s done more digging on Fast and Furious and Benghazi than anyone else?
Attkisson told Laura Ingraham in October 2011 that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting. The DOJ wasn’t happy either:
I’m certainly not the one to make the case for DOJ and White House about what I’m doing wrong. They will tell you that I’m the only reporter–as they told me–that is not reasonable. They say the Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, the New York Times is reasonable, I’m the only one who thinks this is a story, and they think I’m unfair and biased by pursuing it.
Which government sources were aiding and abetting this “unreasonable” reporter? There was one obvious way to find out. Any comment, DOJ?
Here’s the clip. The full Stigall podcast can be found here . Obvious exit question: Whether Attkisson was monitored or not, it can’t be just the AP and Rosen whom the feds have snooped on in four years. How many other reporters?

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/21/1210824/-ObamaCare-Betrayal-Big-Corporations-To-Offer-Health-Insurance-NOT-Covering-Hospital-Stays-Surgery|124 Comments
If you work at Bill Miller Bar-B-Q in Texas, ObamaCare means that you'll get the following insurance plan. Oh, you lucky duckies! From the debacle that is putting preservation of private health insurance corporation profits ahead of public health:
San Antonio-based Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, a 4,200-worker chain, will replace its own mini-med with a new, skinny plan in July. The new plan... will cover only preventive services, six annual doctors' visits and generic drugs. X-rays and tests at a local urgent care chain will also be covered. It wouldn't cover surgeries or hospital stays.
You got that right -- thanks to immoral employers -- and gutless politicians and regulators -- big business will be able to offer the same 'shitty deals' to their employees that they have in the past without getting in any trouble:
Employers are increasingly recognizing they may be able to avoid certain penalties under the federal health law by offering very limited plans that can lack key benefits such as hospital coverage.
Benefits advisers and insurance brokers—bucking a commonly held expectation that the law would broadly enrich benefits—are pitching these low-benefit plans around the country. They cover minimal requirements such as preventive services, but often little more. Some of the plans wouldn't cover surgery, X-rays or prenatal care at all.
Federal officials say this type of plan, in concept, would appear to qualify as acceptable minimum coverage under the law, and let most employers avoid an across-the-workforce $2,000-per-worker penalty for firms that offer nothing.
The idea that such plans would be allowable under the law has emerged only recently. Some benefits advisers still feel they could face regulatory uncertainty. The law requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty. Many employers and benefits experts have understood the rules to require robust insurance, covering a list of "essential" benefits such as mental-health services and a high percentage of workers' overall costs.
Say what?! Employers are set to screw over employees by providing them with coverage that won't even help them pay the bill for a broken leg, and the Federal Government is agreeing with these bastards 'in concept'?
Fuck you, Max Baucus, and weak-kneed Health & Human Services bureaucrats:
But a close reading of the rules makes it clear that those mandates affect only plans sponsored by insurers that are sold to small businesses and individuals, federal officials confirm. That affects only about 30 million of the more than 160 million people with private insurance, including 19 million people covered by employers, according to a Citigroup Inc. C +0.20% report. Larger employers, generally with more than 50 workers, need cover only preventive services, without a lifetime or annual dollar-value limit, in order to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty.
Such policies would generally cost far less to provide than paying the penalty or providing more comprehensive benefits, say benefit-services firms.
Administration officials confirmed in interviews that the skinny plans, in concept, would be sufficient to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty. Several expressed surprise that employers would consider the approach.
Of course, our friends at Aetna and Cigna must be drooling over this travesty -- they make big bucks on junk insurance that covers nothing at all.
In short, from Physicians for a National Health Program :
Imagine health insurance not covering hospitalizations nor surgery. Yet this is still possible because the Affordable Care Act applies the essential health benefit requirement only to plans for small businesses and individuals and not to larger employers.
This has opened up the opportunity for a conspiracy between larger employers who could care less whether or not their employees have health insurance and private insurers who are quite willing to sell these almost worthless bare-bones products as long as there is a profitable market for them.
The solution is obvious. Cover all care that people need, and then provide that coverage to everyone, automatically. Maybe these uncaring employers might not like that, but when the taxes to pay for an equitable system are obligatory, they would get used to the idea of their employees being able to obtain health care when they need it. Not such a bad idea after all, especially when their competitors are treated the same.
Our health care non-system is fucking barbaric, cruel and insane.
SinglePayer (Medicare For All) is the only solution -- clearly, our private insurance and corporate overlords are unwilling to submit to the regulatory oversight necessary to make a 'market-based' Swiss system work in this country.

7 Things About The Mainstream Media That They Do Not Want You To Know
By Michael, on May 20th, 2013
Have you ever wondered who controls the mainstream media?  In America today, we are more "connected" than ever.  The average American watches 153 hours of television a month, and we also spend countless hours watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading books and surfing the Internet.  If someone could control the production of all of that media, that would make them immensely powerful.  They would literally be in a position to tell people what to think.  Well, what if I told you that there are just six enormous media conglomerates that combine to produce about 90 percent of all the media that Americans consume.  Would that alarm you?  It should alarm you.  The truth is that our attitudes, opinions and beliefs are greatly shaped by what we allow into our minds.  After all, they don't call it "programming" for no reason.  Even those of us that realize that we are connected to "the matrix" probably greatly underestimate the tremendous influence that the media has over us.  We live at a time when it is absolutely imperative to think for ourselves, but most Americans are being absolutely overwhelmed with information and seem more than content to let others do their thinking for them.  Sadly, this is greatly contributing to the downfall of our society.
And of course the mainstream media desperately does not want you to look at "the man behind the curtain".  They just want you to stay plugged into the "programming" that they are feeding you without asking any questions.
Fortunately, a growing minority of Americans are waking up and are starting to reject the mainstream media.  An increasing number of people are beginning to recognize that the mainstream media is the mouthpiece of the establishment and that it is promoting the agenda of the establishment.
So why is the mainstream media so bad?  The following are 7 things about the mainstream media that they do not want you to know...
#1 The Mainstream Media Has Very Deep Ties To The Establishment
Did you know that the president of CBS and the president of ABC both have brothers that are top officials in the Obama administration?
The big news networks have developed an almost incestuous relationship with the federal government in recent years.  But of course the same could be said of the relationship that the media has with the big corporations that own stock in their parent companies and that advertise on their networks.
This is one of the reasons why we very rarely ever see any hard hitting stories on the big networks anymore.  The flow of information through the corporate-dominated media is very tightly controlled, and there are a lot of gatekeepers that make sure that the "wrong stories" don't get put out to the public.  As a result, many of the "big stories" that have come out in recent years were originally broken by the alternative media.
#2 The Mainstream Media Gets Things Wrong Very Frequently
Even prominent members of the mainstream media admit that this is the case.  For example, during a recent speech at Quinnipiac University CBS anchor Scott Pelley confessed that journalists in the mainstream media " are getting big stories wrong, over and over again" ...
"Let me take the first arrow: During our coverage of Newtown, I sat on my set and I reported that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the school. And that her son had attacked her classroom. It's a hell of a story, but it was dead wrong. Now, I was the managing editor, I made the decision to go ahead with that and I did, and that's what I said, and I was absolutely wrong. So let me just take the first arrow here."
#3 The American Public Does Not Consider The Media To Be Very Trustworthy
Trust in the mainstream media has definitely been slipping.  In fact, a Gallup poll taken last year found that distrust of the media had reached an all-time high .  According to that poll, 60 percent of Americans "have little or no trust" that the media is reporting the news accurately.
A separate Rasmussen Reports survey found that only 6 percent of all Americans consider the news media to be "very trustworthy".
Hopefully this trend will accelerate and a lot more people will stop trusting the media blindly.
#4 The Mainstream Media And The Politicians That They Worship Hate The Fact That They Cannot Control Internet News Sites
In the old days, the mainstream media had a virtual monopoly on the news.  But these days, anyone with an Internet connection can put up a news site, and this is driving the establishment absolutely bonkers.
For example, Barack Obama is known to have a great dislike for the alternative media.  The following is from a recent  WND article ...
NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd says President Obama was making it “clear” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner over the weekend how he feels about the rise of Internet news sites like Politico, Buzzfeed and … well, WND.
“He hates it.”
Appearing on “Meet the Press” Sunday morning following Saturday night’s media, politics and celebrity soiree, Todd explained the president’s disdain for independent online news sources was showing during his speech.
“It did seem … I thought his pot shots, joke-wise, and then the serious stuff about the Internet, the rise of the Internet media and social media and all that stuff – he hates it, OK? He hates this part of the media,” Todd said. “He really thinks that the, sort of, the buzzification – this isn’t just about Buzzfeed or Politico and all this stuff – he thinks that sort of coverage of political media has hurt political discourse. He hates it. And I think he was just trying to make that clear last night.”
#5 The Mainstream Media Is Extremely Liberal
When it comes to politics, the mainstream media is far more liberal than the general population is.
For example, one survey found that  41 percent of American voters believe that the average reporter is more liberal than they are, while only 18 percent believe that the average reporter is more conservative than they are.
A very disturbing UCLA study on media bias discovered that the vast majority of media outlets are "left of center"...
Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS’ “Evening News,” The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal.
And even MSNBC has confirmed the liberal bias of the media.  According to MSNBC , mainstream journalists are far more likely to donate their own money to Democrats than they are to Republicans...
MSNBC.com identified 143 journalists who made political contributions from 2004 through the start of the 2008 campaign, according to the public records of the Federal Election Commission. Most of the newsroom checkbooks leaned to the left: 125 journalists gave to Democrats and liberal causes. Only 16 gave to Republicans. Two gave to both parties.
#6 Six Mammoth Media Corporations Produce About 90 Percent Of The Media That Americans Consume
As I mentioned at the top of this article, there are six giant media behemoths that control almost all of the media that we consume.  These corporate giants own television networks, cable channels, movie studios, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, video game makers, music labels and even many of our favorite websites.
The media ownership chart posted below originally comes from a previous article that I authored entitled " Who Owns The Media? The 6 Monolithic Corporations That Control Almost Everything We Watch, Hear And Read ", but it has been updated to reflect some of the latest information.  The power that these companies have is so vast that it is hard to put into words...

#7 The American People Are Absolutely Addicted To The Mainstream Media
In a previous article about the media , I noted that the average American watches 153 hours of television a month.
When you allow that much information to be downloaded into your brain, it is going to have a dramatic impact on how you think.
Americans are more "connected" than they ever have been before.  This is especially true of our kids.  They are constantly on one sort of electronic device or another.  The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Daniel Taylor ...
According to a 2010 LA Times report , young people spend on average 53 hours a week watching TV, playing video games, and sitting at the computer.
Facebook users spend about 15 hours a month on the social networking site.
People are walking – and driving – blindly while texting, sometimes walking into fountains and even falling off cliffs.
If that Los Angeles Times report is true, that means that our young people are spending more than 200 hours a month connected to the media.
But we are only awake for about 480 hours a month.
When it comes to influencing the American people, nobody has more power than the big media companies do.
And until we can break this sick addiction to the mainstream media and get people to start thinking for themselves, we will never see widespread changes in our society.  As long as people are being "programmed" by the mainstream media, they will continue to express the opinions, attitudes and beliefs that have been downloaded into their minds.
Please share this article with as many people as you can.  It is crucial that we wake as many people up as possible while we still can.

Turning it off is the best thing any of us can do to fight back.  When your friends and family start talking about this or that on TV, say “sorry, we don’t watch TV” and check out the look on their faces.  We’ve been a Zero TV Home since 1998 and love that look.  And we don’t miss TV one tiny bit.

That’s exactly what they want you to think! “L v R.” How about there is no difference between the two parties? If there were, you’d actually see laws that one side passed being overturned by the other, yet that is NEVER the case. I’ve watched this for 60 years and it’s always the same. The only difference is that each election cycle new people take a side. Wake up folks! There’s only one side and you aren’t on it!

Those six media giants that control everything are themselves part of a world-wide, intertwined group of ultra-powerful corporations that are, in turn, controlled by a number of mega-corporations under the most powerful families on Earth.  They always were and they always will be.  I used to think that was the stuff of conspiracy nuts, but those ultra-powerful people don’t even try to keep it a secret anymore.

I don’t think many people here are quite grasping what you mean by “super rich”.  Very few Hollywood type celebrities are even close to super wealthy, they have just enough to shut them up and keep them entertaining the peasants.
Come to think of it I don’t think they get what you mean by liberal either.  Bill Gates and George Soros?  Super wealthy, yes, liberal, well I think that’s debatable.  It’s one thing to talk the talk and throw a little money to charity as a token gesture, it’s quite another to actually accept a downgrade in one’s own lifestyle in order to allow others a chance in the game of life.  Names like Rockefeller are what we’re really looking at when we talk about super rich, and I don’t think they have ever been accused of being liberal.

Ironically, Rush Bimbo is and has been a part of the problem.  Just like Pawn Hannity and others, they supported/defended GWB’s TYRANNY and then they talk against Obama’s TYRANNY, when in fact it all goes hand in hand!  That is their job, the PROSTITUTES in the media, to keep you all confused with the 2 party…1 party system.  You all believe their is one ounce of difference in the 2 parties???  Yes…you say.  Ahhh, the production based programming for theater is working just as it was designed to…for you SHEEPLE!
El Pollo de Oro
Ricky Ross; Very insightful post. Rush “Pillhead” Limbaugh (the OxyContin king), Bill-O The Clown and other neocons are propagandists for the Repuli-Con wing of the War Party, while MSNBC (also known as ONN, the Obama News Network) are propagandists for the Democrap wing of the War Party. But the American sheeple, to a large degree, are gullible tribalists. So they could care less how much “our guy” rapes and pillages as long as it is “our guy.” Faux News and MSNBC serve different wings of the War Party, but both serve the War Party.
“Barack Obama is so dangerous because he makes people that are traditionally anti-torture, anti-war, anti-police state just say, ‘Hey, I want NDAA. I want troops on the street. I want TSA sticking their hands down our pants. I want banker bailouts because it’s Obama.’  And strong conservatives went to sleep under Bush because hey, he’s a Republican.”—Alex Jones
“All the two parties are fighting for is who gets to
be the whore, the prostitute for the interest groups.”—Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
“I will not vote for the lesser of two evils. I will not support this criminality any
longer. I will not vote for the Gambinos or the Bonannos. I will not vote for the Republicans or the Democrats. To me, it’s a two-bit freak show.”—Gerald Celente
Lennie Pike
I agree. There will be outrage from Fox News, “conservative” radio, and the Republican Party – all a kabooki show for people who do not think for themselves. Control the fiat money scam and “they” control everything and everyone – almost

These so-called scandals have yet to place any criminality in the hands of the White House, unlike Watergate.

I honestly believe that Obama could be found–concrete and irrefutable evidence–to have ordered guns given to Mexican drug cartels, or given weapons to Al Quaeda in Libya which were used to kill Americans and destroy our embassy, or even joked about his use of the IRS to bully his political opponents–there could be evidence that he had his hand directly in all of these things and he would still be untouched……
OH, WAIT!!!….He actually was complicit in all of these events and the public and media responds with a yawn.
He could probably get caught like Marion Barry of DC with a crack pipe and hooker on tape and would still have tens of millions fawning at his feet………
Obama (like Oprah) is a cult………

I agree. In another article I wrote about this. I blame the feminist movement. They took the most important role in society and vilified it. Then, they convinced the women that they MUST join the slave/work force to be considered successful. Pitiful, but it worked just like it was supposed to. And now look at us.
Graham
Feminism also substantially increased the tax revenue that the IRS could collect.  They referred to it as the other 50%.
In a planned double whammy (see Rockefeller history), it also led to the breakup of the traditional family unit where kids were simply passed to the “State” for education.  The parents got bizzy elsewhere.
Other things have been strongly promoted since and it is being pushed everywhere left, right and centre.  The aim is moral and societal destruction at every conceivable level.
I will refrain from naming the specific group who are responsible for such outrageous mayhem.  They create war as well.
They also electronically create money in a similar fashion to yanking a rabbit out of a hat then charging the public for the pet food to keep all the rabbits alive.
Those in their 40′s/50′s/60′s plus must be going through a daily mind warp trying to figure it all out.

Children are born with a clean slate, pure, with no ideological hang-ups to dampen their wonder of the world around them.  It’s the parents and society that teaches them to be bigoted, and they mimic their parents bigotry because they adore them and want to please them.  Personally I think having two loving parents, regardless of gender, is worth a lot more to a child than having one or two dysfunctional ones.  But, sigh, homophobia is a great distraction from the real issues at hand, and it works wonders to divide communities.

What stuns me the most is this: this week, Obama’s approval rating actually increased to 53%, despite the scandals going on. This just goes to show how apathetic most Americans have become. Even worse, this sends the message that Obama, and the Government as a whole, can pretty much do whatever they want at this point, since the public is unlikely to go after them. If this isn’t a bad sign, I don’t know what is.

Brainiac was also a continuing character in DC comic books in the 60′s and 70′s. He was a green skinned, super intelligent android that regularly crossed swords with Superman.  He had stolen an entire Kryptonian city before the planet was destroyed when it’s sun went nova, and kept it miniaturized in a bottle so that he could study the inhabitants.  Superman got wind of this and recovered Kandor after an epic battle with Bainiac.

yes, the mainstream media is our enemy. A wise person knows their enemy inside and out. Watching the national news is NOT a waste of time. I watch every night then go and find the truth by other means and measure the difference.

I love to compare and contrast the way the different news outlets portray situations.  They can certainly draw opposite conclusions among them.  They especially love to isolate one seemingly positive bit of economic news and try to convince the viewers that we’re in a real recovery. Never mind the other negative bits that continue to decline.
Graham
Yes… we are in a “recovery” and hopefully it will continue to blossom.
I refer to the many who appear to be rediscovering their own voice, sanity and consciousness (waking up).
Graham
Likewise.  I strongly believe all sides of the coin have to be observed in order to properly dissect and compartmentalise who is saying what and why.
As the MSM ratings continue to suffer, I note they refer often to the alternate media, usually trying to beat it down.  This will change after the recent “trilogy” of high profile “blunders”.
Even BritBoy Redcoat Pierce Morgan is changing his tune on the tyranny front.  Next week he will likely be pushing 3D printers or the new laser rifle.

The mainstream aka government controlled media is the tool by which we are heading like a speed train to secular totalitarianism and pervasive evil. The government and the media [except for Newscorp/Fox] is the means by which traditional America and our founding Judaio-Christian value system is evaporating. If the true facts of a story cannot be controlled, manipulated to fit the mainstream left wing secular outcome, it is ignored by all of the large media outlets. Remember how the lefty devils in the media ran with the phony rigged up Duke Lacrosse rape case until they could not push the lie any further ? There have been countless examples since 8+15+1969, where the mainstream liars contorted or ignored facts to fit their secular outcome.I used to sit and watch the evening news in the 70′s with my mother. I would ask her why the three networks would cover the same stories. She did not know then, but we all know now.  Recently, the murdering infanticide doctors Gosnell and the latest from Texas receive almost no coverage by the secular totalitarian left. Remember the liars on the left saying that legal abortion, aka murder, would prevent back alley abortions. MURDERING LIARS. Look at these death camps run by Planned Parenthood. The blaspemy by OB asking God to bless PP was outragious. Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Lifers assemble peacefully in Washington each year and this receives little to no coverage from the government controlled media. The crushing budget deficits and the national debt receives almost no coverage. Pres. Obama would not have been able to pass a security clearance for most government jobs and is our sitting President for two terms because the government controlled media decided to ignore his school records and much of his past. Mitt Romney, a good virtuous man, was run out of town by the demons on the left. The left wing media knows that Benghazi is 10 times worse than Watergate and will only give it slight coverage. The government controlled company line and outcome is that we will learn from it and we will move forward. The phony Watergate scandal was drilled into our heads for ten years. No Americans died because of Watergate but we fed four Americans to the wolves in Benghazi. American lives are wothless to these globalist totalitarians. Meanwhile, we have wire tapping and spying going on 24/7. When will America wake up ? When will America sober up and realize that this secularsocial experiment which metastasised on 8+15+1969 is a world wrecking failure. Shame on you Judas Catholics for what your have done.

Back in the day when the MSM was not a parrot to the shadow gubermint, one would hear news stories from different MSM outlets and they would never be identical like today. You could tell each news outlet was doing their own work and seeing things differently. Not today….and technology has nothing to do with it. It’s no secret the shadow gubermint is in bed with the media…more like the media’s masters and overseers. Always remember the 3 tools these miscreants have at their  disposal: Intimidation…Manipulation…Provocation. 99% of the time you can attribute at least 1 of these tools to their dirty deeds…it’s their finger print.

The inability of the elites to control anything led them to push mainstream media on the forefront with the false hope that by manipulating peoples perceptions and beliefs would convince everybody that they are in control when in reality they cannot drive their own car.
They really think that people can be totally programmed to believe that some super wealthy elite is pulling all the strings on this planet and everybody else should bow down to them.
Very funny. Our elites are becoming our clowns!

This administration is using the cheating wife technique. "Even if caught in the act, deny everything."
As long as they do that and have the support of the news media, they hope to hold out until the news media puts everyone back to sleep.

All we need is one good man or woman to do the right thing.  Hamm, Petraeus, someone.  Petraeus could get some respect back.

You're right on top of it. Petraeus was a four star general and the director of the CIA. I find it hard to believe there was something happening like this and he was totally out of the loop.
As the CIA director he probably had to accept the loss of life as the leader of the Agency. As a military man, it appears he abandoned the two brave seals. If he did know something and testified to it it would show that he still had military character. If he didn't know anything he was probably padding his pension as the CIA director. But as four star generals go, he might as well have got the stars as prizes from Cracker Jack

Ham and Petraeus: lions in the field and lambs in the hall, in an odd twist. I know I'm brave to volunteer them for risking their freedom by sharing classified info, but hell, I can't do it myself. I only know as much as Hillary and Obama.

Faceless, appreciate your view, however; a lion is a lion whether in the jungle or a zoo. Is Petraeus simply an administrative lion/political general in the end?

(And then remove the Commanders that wanted to rush in help!)  Plus deliberately sending that Ambassador into that specific place and time and then the attack starts within one hour of time of his scheduled meeting.  Explain that behavior.  The best explanations I've seen is that the intent was to set up a kidnapping of the Ambassador for an exchange for the Egyptian Cleric we hold in jail (AND that Obama had tried earlier to send back to Egypt but Congress intervened).  The motive could have been to make Obama look strong in foreign relations just before the election.  I have no idea if that was true, but the explanations that the administration has provided DO NOT support what happened.
Only the explanation that the attack was expected and supported for "some" purpose provides the motive for the repeated denied extra security and repeated "Stand Down" orders given to do those that wanted and COULD HAVE provided aid.
Other explanations center around the likelihood of secret arms shipments being passed through Libya orchestrated by Ambassador Stevens.  But I don't think it explains the clear effort to deny security and aid.  Somebody wanted the bad guys at the gate to be successful in their intrusion.  My guess it wasn't supposed to kill anyone but the four Seals that returned to help (although having been told NOT to) provided a means to fight back and things soon got out of control.  Then the administration was in need of do some very fast track covering to avoid discovery.  The FBI wasn't even on site to do any investigating until a MONTH later.  And all the injured where kept away from the press.  And Hillary suddenly banged her head and avoided Congress.  Delay, delay.  Nothing to see here, move on.  And now,  of course, we hear from Hillary, "What Difference Does It Make??".  Clearly they hope that the answer is now that it doesn't..
Just the normal bumbling of the administration does not explain why they took such coordinated efforts to avoid providing aid.  There was NO real risk to the politicians in sending aid.  In fact, it was the LOW risk decision even if it was too late.   But it was actively denied.  Politicians would want to be seen as acting to help UNLESS something else more important to them was intended.
Note, that the whole IRS mess was deliberately released by the Gov itself!!  Just imagine that.  WHY would the IRS be told to tell a reporter to ask a specific question at a press conference just to be able to reveal what they've been up to.  We would not even have knowledge of what the IRS had been doing without having the culprits themselves revealing it!!!  (Plus it is a scandal that Obama is personally well isolated from while the Benghazi affair he ISN'T.)  Remember the best way to refocus an investigation is to start a bigger or more visible or more accessible fire somewhere else.
I'm not a conspiracy nut, but clearly this administration is fully capable of using false flags and false rescues if it served their political purposes.  These guys have NO moral compasses.  (Most politicians are capable of such.)
I suspect that if the truth does come out, Obama could be impeached.  But he has incredible powers to keep things suppressed, dodge the blame and pin the responsibility elsewhere.  I'm not overly confident that we'll know the truth while he is in office.  Maybe never.  But keeping such big secrets is very difficult especially after the culprit is no longer President and no longer has suppressive powers.
Don’t let up.  Keep digging.  Clearly there is something VERY, VERY, VALUABLE buried there.  They’ll take almost any scandal hit rather than let Benghazi be fully discovered.

More than a few people think it was a hit, that Stevens had to go. Whatever the true story, it is lethal, and it is why the other scandals emerged at the same time. They do not want this uncovered.

I've always thought the video was a loose end (among all the others). If they already knew it was a crock, how come it surfaced so conveniently? And how come the producer Noukala is still in prison? Something else stinks from that angle.

http://original.antiwar.com/vlahos/2013/05/21/antiwar-com-sues-fbi-after-secret-surveillance/|Share This
WASHINGTON – Antiwar.com is taking the FBI to court.
The website’s founder and managing editor Eric Garris, along with longtime editorial director Justin Raimondo, filed a lawsuit in federal court today, demanding the release of records they believe the FBI is keeping on them and the 17-year-old online magazine.
Antiwar.com says this is one more example of post-9/11 government overreach, and a stark reminder that the First Amendment has been treated as little more than a speed bump on the road to a government surveillance state. The lawsuit is particularly timely, considering recent scandals in which the Department of Justice secretly seized months of journalists’ phone records at the Associated Press, and did the same and more to a FOX News reporter , while the IRS is acknowledging it singled out conservative groups that criticize the government for extra scrutiny.
Suddenly, the press is more aware than ever that the state has the ability to secretly monitor its activities, heretofore thought of as constitutionally protected from government interference and intimidation.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy, whether it’s AP or Antiwar.com,” said Julia Harumi Mass, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which is representing Antiwar.com in the case. “FBI surveillance of news organizations interferes with journalists’ ability to do their jobs as watchdogs that hold the government accountable.”
The suit was filed on Tuesday at the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. Both Garris and Raimondo live and work in the San Francisco Bay area.
According to the suit, the ACLU has made several futile attempts to obtain the FBI files since a reader alerted Garris and Raimondo to this lengthy FBI memo in 2011. The details in question begin at page 62 of the heavily redacted 94-page document. It’s clear from these documents, the suit alleges, that the FBI has files on Garris and Raimondo, and at one point the FBI agent writing the April 30, 2004 memo on Antiwar.com recommends further monitoring of the website in the form of opening a “preliminary investigation …to determine if [redaction] are engaging in, or have engaged in, activities which constitute a threat to national security.”
“On one hand it seemed almost funny that we would be considered a threat to national security, but it’s very scary, because what we are engaging in is free speech, and free speech by ordinary citizens and journalists is now being considered a threat to national security and they don’t have to prove it because the government has the ability to suppress information and not disclose any of their activities – as witnessed with what is going on now at the AP and other things,” said Garris.
“The government’s attitude is they want to know all, but they want the public to know as little as possible.”
In response, the ACLU began filing requests in December 2011 under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for any records the FBI was currently holding on Antiwar.com, which describes itself as a Libertarian-inspired project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. It was clear from reading the memo that Antiwar.com came under the radar in part for its mission, which is characterized as publishing a non-interventionist “online magazine and research tool designed to keep the American people and the world informed about the overseas plans of the American government.” [Full disclosure, this writer is a regular contributor].
While openly acknowledging that we have an agenda, the editors take seriously our purely journalistic mission, which is to get past the media filters and reveal the truth about America’s foreign policy. Citing a wide variety of sources without fear or favor, and presenting our own views in the regular columns of various contributors, we clearly differentiate between fact and opinion, and let our readers know which is which.
The website was also targeted, according to the FBI memo, for links it published to counter-terrorism watch lists (which were already in the public domain), and for the people who were visiting Antiwar.com and/or talking it up at rallies. The FBI noted at least two of Raimondo’s columns and wondered openly, “who are (Antiwar.com’s) contributors and what are the funds utilized for?” This, after acknowledging there was no evidence of any crime being plotted or committed.
“This illustrates the troubling, continuing efforts of the federal government to monitor protected speech activity without evidence or even allegation of criminal activity,” said Mass, who explained that there are specific prohibitions against such surveillance and record-keeping in the 1974 Privacy Act [5 U.S.C 552a(e)(7)] .
After Raimondo wrote about the FBI memo in August 2011 , which at the time, independent journalist Marcy Wheeler at EmptyWheel.net deemed a “troubling story,” Antiwar.com started losing donors, and according to the lawsuit, it was big time.
In October 2011, one of Antiwar.com’s major donors withdrew his financial support from Antiwar.com out of concern that the FBI would monitor him if he continued to provide, as he wished to do, financial support to Antiwar.com. Since then, three significant donors have also withdrawn financial support, citing their fear that FBI interest in Antiwar.com would lead to surveillance of the donors as a reason for withdrawing financial support. As a result, Antiwar.com has lost about $75,000 per year since 2011 in otherwise expected contributions.
Reached over the weekend, Wheeler, who routinely investigates and reports on the impact of post-9/11 government surveillance on civil liberties for EmptyWheel.net , voiced her concern about the apparent FBI surveillance of Antiwar.com and its far-reaching implications.
“It’s likely (the) FBI is hiding one or another things: Bush era investigations into the peace community that were improper to start with, and/or the degree to which First Amendment activities have become one reason to investigate completely innocent activity,” she said.
After a series of FOIA requests, amended requests and empty responses, Garris and Raimondo have “received no agency determination setting forth whether Defendant FBI intends to produce records or any basis for withholding them,” since the last request dated May 24, 2012. Taking it to court, Mass said, is the next step.
“Our clients are entitled to obtain records the FBI has gathered about them and their online magazine,” she said. “This is especially important because the FBI’s surveillance has impacted our clients’ ability to maintain support for their website and has impacted their editorial choices– exactly the type of harm the First Amendment is supposed to protect against.”
How it went down
The strange and unsettling story of Antiwar.com’s debut into the domestic War on Terror came in the summer of 2011, when a reader warned Garris and Raimondo that the website had been mentioned as a target of surveillance by the FBI in the batch of documents the reader said he obtained through a FOIA request and had subsequently posted on his blog.
The documents mostly concern a 2001 investigation of five Israeli nationals who were witnessed smiling and celebrating and taking pictures of the burning Twin Towers from a rooftop perch across the river from Manhattan in Union City, New Jersey, on 9/11. After witnesses called the police, the individuals, who all worked for a local moving company, were taken into custody and grilled by FBI and CIA for two months after it was deemed their work visas had expired, and there was a big wad of cash, box cutters and other items that raised red flags found in a search of their work van. Questions revolved around whether the Israelis were spies connected to the Israeli government, and whether they had foreknowledge of the tragic events.
The heavily redacted memo says the men were eventually deported back to Israel without charge, and the case closed. However, the FBI still had an interest in tracking evidence gleaned from the case and this is where Antiwar.com comes into the picture. Raimondo, in writing about the case of the five Israelis in 2002 , linked to an American-generated terror watchlist (which had been published elsewhere on the Internet) that went out to Italian financial institutions and it included the name of the man who owned the New Jersey moving company in question.
It is not clear whether this sparked further monitoring of Antiwar.com, or whether Antiwar.com was already in the FBI’s sights. Interestingly, the memo states that the information attached to the memo as supporting material (none of which was available, aside from copies of two of Raimondo’s articles), was obtained in part through a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) request.
The FBI said it also searched the Web, as well as Lexis-Nexis, the Universal Index (FBI central records), the agency’s Electronic Case File, Department of Motor Vehicles and Dunn & Bradsheet (credit reports) for information on Antiwar.com and for “one or more individuals” working for the website.
Some of the things that can be discerned from those searches and were noted in the FBI memo:
– That Raimondo had been writing about the five Israelis and in his columns linked to at least three different terror watch lists (all found in the public domain).
–That Antiwar.com was cited in an article, the name of the author redacted, about U.S aid to Israel.
– That an article that listed Antiwar.com as a reference was handed out in 2002 at a “peaceful protest” at a British air base in the U.K.
– That a member of a domestic neo-Nazi group had “discussed a website, Antiwar.com” while encouraging fellow members at a conference to “educate themselves” about the Middle East conflict.
– That a special agent’s review of hard drives seized during an investigation of an unnamed subject, revealed that the subject had visited Antiwar.com between July 25, 2002 and June 15, 2003, “among many other websites.”
“There are several unanswered questions regarding www.antiwar.com,” reads the FBI memo. “It describes itself as a non-profit group that survives on generous contributions from its readers. Who are these contributors and what are the funds used for?”
The memo goes on to say that “many individuals worldwide do view this website including individuals who are currently under investigation and [two lines redacted].”
The unidentified agent writing the memo concludes, “it is recommended that ECAU (Electronic Communications Analysis Unit) further monitor the postings on the website … it is recommended that a PI (preliminary investigation) is opened to determine if [line redacted] have engaged in, or are engaging in, activities which constitute a threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power.”
This is the decisive point of the memo as it pertains to Antiwar.com: that Garris and Raimondo and Antiwar.com, for writing about a particularly sensitive subject and for linking to information that is already circulating around the Internet, may be a “threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power,” and therefore subject to secret surveillance. That would make any journalist, who say, linked a story to documents published by Wikileaks, which is currently under federal investigation , suspect too, surmised the plaintiffs.
“This sort of government activity is so chilling because it puts the fear of government at a higher level, and among the news media,” said Garris, noting the negative effect that federal leak investigations are already having on the free press. “Once the people aren’t able to get information, the government can, potentially, have unlimited power.”
According to Mass, the ACLU is filing a separate, administrative request to the FBI to find and further expunge any files it may have on Garris and Raimondo.
“The government,” concluded Mass, “cannot keep records about people’s exercise of free speech unless it is related to a criminal investigation.”
Update: Antiwar.com contacted the FBI for a statement for this story. A press official there declined, saying the agency could not comment on pending litigation.

The Obama administration has gotten itself into a fix between its contradictory stories about the Benghazi incident, reports of the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Justice Department’s grabbing of phone records from AP reporters. There are few things more fun to watch than arrogant political leaders -- folks who spend their lives bossing everyone around -- getting a comeuppance.

My favorite take wasn’t from any serious commentator but from comedian Jon Stewart, who noticed that the president routinely claims ignorance about embarrassing events by saying that he learned of them while watching the news: “I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announcing it on television.”
I take a bipartisan approach to Washington, DC’s political scandals and find myself savoring them all, regardless of the party that is in control of the White House. Any sane person would conclude that all administrations and bureaucracies essentially are corrupt given that they thrive on the exertion of power of other people. We know about the corrupting influence of power, and DC has become like ancient Rome that way. It’s a magnet for those seeking favor, money, or a big title administering some pointless program.
I visited DC last week and was astounded at the booming economy, the endless new construction, the astronomical prices, and garish displays of wealth everywhere -- not to mention the haughty attitudes of every pissant assistant to the whatever. That’s what Other People’s Money buys you. When Ronald Reagan talked about the Shining City on the Hill he was speaking metaphorically about America, but the new shining city is DC -- funded on the backs of all those Americans who blithely vote for people who promise to solve their problems.
That’s the main lesson from this latest mess: the federal government is an untamable beast. These superficial scandals are nothing compared to the things we will never learn -- i.e., the way the CIA conducts its business overseas.
Still, there are so many things to savor as President Obama circles the drain. Obama has always exuded an intellectual arrogance. Yet if he’s so smart, why would his Justice Department target reporters? The national media has fawned over the president, but the quickest way to end that love affair is to go after their personal records.
Unfortunately, many people insist on seeing every scandal in terms of partisanship. Conservatives are aghast, as they should be, at the thought of an IRS auditing groups based on their political views. That is eerily totalitarian. But where would they have been had a Republican administration done the same thing to liberal critics? I doubt the activist groups would be sending out the alarmist direct-mail pieces if the latest Bush were still president.
The best news from the ongoing drama is that people on the left and right see problems here. Let’s use that as a foundation for a renewed civil-liberties coalition that understands that there are many bright red lines in which the government -- regardless of who nominally is at the head of it -- does not cross. That’s easier to do when one realizes that our supposedly limited government is so limitless in its size, power, and taxing ability that no president can control it.
When pundits complain about excess partisanship, what they usually are really saying is they are tired of all the political fighting. Yet political fighting is good -- it’s a sign of differences of opinion and assures that important issues get debated, however clumsily, in the public.
In Sacramento, California, the Republican Party has imploded and there is little worry about partisanship. But the state’s Democratic Party is now engaged in policies so secretive that even liberal-oriented pundits are getting concerned. No one has the power to say no, so the Democrats are ramming through every manner of dangerous bill.
The new health-exchange law shields most contracts under a veil of secrecy so that public money can be dispensed to friends and cronies without the public learning about where it is going. Democratic leaders have embraced a gut-and-amend frenzy -- proposing dozens of bills with placeholder language that will be stripped away at the last minute with new and completely different language inserted. This circumvents normal debate and oversight.
This is not a Democratic problem per se, but a government problem. And local governments are arguably even more dangerous to our liberties. In Bakersfield recently, after Kern County sheriff’s deputies beat to death a young father (after being called to the scene for a minor incident -- public drunkenness), they grabbed the cellphones of bystanders who were recording the incident. That’s right out of a police state.
Government is about power and force. Many people charged with power over others will abuse it. That’s human nature. Unfortunately, the nation’s founding ideals -- limited, accountable government, with separated powers and checks and balances -- have been fading away. Government is so big that even the president and the attorney general claim they have no idea what their departments are doing. I almost believe them.
We need to rebuild a coalition of civil libertarians of the left and right who agree to some basics, on some bright red lines that no government should cross. We need to provide a unified, bipartisan front on behalf of individual liberties and against any official from any party who would trample them. Maybe we can learn that constructive lesson from the administration’s unreconstructed behavior.

Yeah I have seen this before, I would love to search the web for more enlightening vids on people like this but geez, time is never on my side. I can't believe he openly said people need to be brainwashed, if that's not proof that the government does the subliminal messaging, you'll never wake up. God﻿ gave us freewill, brainwashing is just another example that our leaders are GODLESS. Our government has forsaken us, abandoned EVERYTHING our forefathers wanted, DONE what they had warned.

Tom Coburn, James Inhofe(Credit: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/AP/Sue Ogrocki)
Just a week ago, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe suggested that President Obama might be impeached over the Benghazi non-scandal. Now, Inhofe must watch as Obama declares Inhofe’s state a disaster area and promises Oklahomans “all the resources they need at their disposal.”
Inhofe, of course, believes his state deserves those resources, even though he voted down aid to Hurricane Sandy victims. On MSNBC, Chris Jansing confronted Inhofe about his calling the Sandy aid bill a “slush fund,” and the brazen right-winger insisted the two issues shouldn’t be linked.
“Let’s look at that, that was totally different,” Inhofe told Jansing. “They were getting things — for instance that was supposed to be in New Jersey, they had things in the Virgin Islands, they were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C.; everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma.”
Inhofe’s answer is too dishonest to fully parse. First of all, there was Sandy damage way beyond New Jersey, including in the Caribbean and in Washington, D.C., too. And Inhofe had different objections to the Sandy bill at the time. In a rambling, hard-to-follow Senate floor speech blocking Sandy aid last December, the Oklahoma conservative objected to the bill’s timing — “There’s always a lot of theater right before Christmas time … We shouldn’t be talking about it right before Christmas” — even though it was already going on two months since the storm ravaged the East Coast.
Inhofe was also exercised by the fact that the Sandy bill included what he said was $28 billion for future disasters. But the climate-change denier was particularly outraged that the bill included $3.5 billion to deal with what he called “global warming,” which led to a long rant against cap-and-trade legislation, and then his floor speech unraveled. (Interestingly, Inhofe’s own press operation put the incoherent speech up on YouTube , as though it was a proud moment for the senator.)
Oklahoma’s other GOP senator, Tom Coburn, brags that he’s going to seek tornado relief — but insist that the funding is “offset” by other cuts to the federal budget. Coburn is proud that he’s being consistent by placing the same conditions on disaster aid to his own state as he’s demanded elsewhere. Consistent, maybe — but also fundamentally cruel.
Especially in the wake of the sequester cuts, the notion that the federal budget is larded with easily eliminated spending is ludicrous. Would Coburn like to see more kids thrown out of Head Start? More seniors losing Meals on Wheels? The federal deficit is shrinking faster than at any time since just after World War II, but Coburn is going to insist that someone, somewhere, must lose their federal help so Oklahoma can get it instead.
There’s something so typical about today’s GOP in the way Inhofe can dismiss comparisons between tornado aid and Sandy aid while Coburn grandstands for his long-term demand that new spending, even on disaster relief, must be “offset” by cuts elsewhere. Meanwhile, the notion that a new disaster relief bill should include funding to cope with future disasters isn’t lauded as common sense, it’s derided as pork. Like Inhofe, Coburn objected to the Sandy bill’s including funding for future disaster relief. (It should be noted that Moore, Okla., Rep. Tom Cole, also a Republican, voted for the Sandy aid bill.)
Just as modern conservatism helped create categories of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor, we now apparently have deserving and undeserving disasters. When tragedy strikes, most Americans tend to want to pull together, but many Republicans look to pull us apart, placing their own constituents’ needs above everyone else’s.

E.W. Jackson, the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor, began his career as a minister and attorney in Boston. While there, he lent his support to a high-profile 1988 fight against a plan to desegregate public housing developments in the neighborhood of South Boston.
The 1988 battle over housing desegregation in South Boston began after the federal government found the city of Boston had illegally segregated public housing and prevented African Americans from moving into public developments in the neighborhood. Boston was ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to come up with a new tenant selection plan or face a federal takeover of its public housing system. As a result, Ray Flynn, the city’s mayor, came up with a desegregation plan.
Local news station WGBH filmed Jackson giving a speech at a July 1988 community meeting in South Boston hosted by opponents of the mayor’s desegregation plan. According to WGBH, at the event Jackson dismissed the desegregation plan as “social engineering.” In his remarks, Jackson characterized the matter as a question of freedom of choice.
“I am so tired of hearing the people of South Boston dumped on by the saviors of mankind that it makes me nauseous,” Jackson said of desegregation advocates. “I can understand the reaction of the people of South Boston apart from the racial issue because I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either.”
Jackson, who was identified as a radio station manager and pastor of the New Corner Baptist Church in Roxbury, also spoke with a reporter from WGBH. In the interview, he indicated he believed people should be allowed to choose to live separately from members of other races.
“I think that maximum emphasis needs to be put on the ability of people to choose, even if that means some housing developments are predominantly of one race or another,” said Jackson.
The reporter who interviewed him also asked Jackson, who is African-American, if he felt as though he was being “used” by white politicians who opposed the desegregation plan. His response made it clear he fully supported their efforts.
“Well, the scripture says it’s a good thing to be used in a good cause,” Jackson said.
According to the biography on his campaign website , Jackson first moved to Boston with his wife, Theodora, in 1971 as part of his service in the U.S. Marine Corps. He and his wife left the city in 1998, a decision that was partly motivated, by “their desire for an environment more compatible with their conservative and Christian values.”
Since he was nominated to run in the gubernatorial race alongside Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli over the weekend, Jackson has drawn widespread attention for his past comments criticizing gays . He accused President Barack Obama of harboring “Muslim sensibilities.” and A video he once filmed compared Planned Parenthood to the KKK.
Jackson and the Cuccinelli campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

http://blogs.findlaw.com/in_house/2013/03/the-double-irish-tax-loophole---can-your-company-exploit-it.html|The 'Double Irish' Tax Loophole: Can Your Company Exploit it?
By William Peacock, Esq. on March 20, 2013 11:50 AM
"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich." Sounds like two Guinnesses and something made out of chicken, doesn't it? It's making us hungry.
It's not food and drink, however. It's a complicated corporate tax loophole, exploited by tech companies and others with intellectual property, pioneered by Apple, and used by many to save billions of dollars in taxes.
It all begins with the licensing of patents and IP to an Irish subsidiary. When products are sold in the U.S., taxes are reduced by paying royalties to that subsidiary. Under Irish law, if the subsidiary is managed by foreigners, profits skip along, Irish tax-free, usually to a Caribbean tax haven.
When products are sold outside of the U.S., profits are directed to another Irish subsidiary, who forwards the profits to the Netherlands under a tax-free treaty, which kicks the profits back to the initial Irish subsidiary, which exploits the same foreign-manager tax loophole to send money to the Caribbean.
Confused yet? Here's a pretty diagram , courtesy of the New York Times.
(Apple's innovations go far beyond the iPhone, don't they?)
Your first question: Is this all legal? It better be, as a number of tech companies are doing it, including Amazon and Google , reports CNBC.
Then again, not all of them are succeeding. The problem comes down to the value of that intellectual property, or " transfer pricing ." How much is a patent worth? When a company is licensing patents to itself, it's going to be tempted to set the value to the amount that will best benefit itself tax-wise. (Higher valuation means larger business expense deduction.)
Instead, companies are supposed to determine prices at "arm's length", meaning whatever price would be appropriate if they weren't licensing to themselves.
Inappropriate transfer pricing does come back to haunt some companies. In December, the Internal Revenue Service went after Amazon for $234 million in back taxes , claiming over-valuation of IP. Of course, the IRS is not always successful. They famously lost a similar case against Veritas Software (now part of Symantec) in 2010.
With all of that said, should you advise your company to take the same route? The savings don't lie: One study estimates that Apple saved between $2.4 and $4.8 billion in taxes . Just be sure that your transfer pricing is reasonable. (And if you aren't a tax lawyer, it's time to consult outside counsel.)

The landmark legislation easily passed the Judiciary Committee, giving reform its best chance in six years on the Senate floor. Yet even if the bill clears the Senate, the GOP-controlled House isn’t likely to take it up in its current form.
( PHOTOS: At a glance: The Senate immigration deal )
The vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments. But the Gang of Eight, which drafted the legislation, held together and fended off all but minor changes to the bill.
“This is a big step forward,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Gang. “We got a good vote in committee, we expanded our little group to another vote, and the feeling is very strong here. I think we gained some momentum today. I really do.”
Schumer and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters that they remained hopeful that the bill could pick up 70 votes on the Senate floor.
“I think it’s possible,” said Flake, another Gang member. “We got a lot of hard work to do. A lot of hard work.”
The committee room, which was packed with reform proponents, erupted in applause and cheers of “Yes, we can” after the final vote. Democratic senators posed for pictures with supporters and received a succession of high fives and hugs.
President Barack Obama issued a statement congratulating the committee and urging the Senate to take up the bill “at the earliest possible opportunity.”
( Also on POLITICO: House immigration talks hang on health care )
“The process for considering this legislation has been open and inclusive with multiple hearings, and more than a hundred amendments were considered and adopted, in many cases with bipartisan support,” Obama said. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I , but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”
Senate leaders hope to begin considering the bill following the Memorial Day recess in June. That prospect got a boost on Tuesday when Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would not block debate from starting on the floor.
House leaders want their members to put forward their own version of immigration reform, which will be more conservative than the Senate bill. A bipartisan group of House negotiators announced an agreement last week on reform principles, but the lawmakers are struggling to finalize the deal.

http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-predictable-failure-of-fiscal-austerity-by-robert-skidelsky|Austere Illusions
LONDON – The doctrine of imposing present pain for future benefit has a long history – stretching all the way back to Adam Smith and his praise of “parsimony.” It is particularly vociferous in “hard times.” In 1930, US President Herbert Hoover was advised by his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system...People will...live a more moral life...and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.”
To “liquidationists” of Mellon’s ilk, the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking, in housing, in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored. Their position is clear: the state is a parasite, sucking the lifeblood of free enterprise. Economies gravitate naturally to a full-employment equilibrium, and, after a shock, do so fairly quickly if not impeded by misguided government action. This is why they are fierce opponents of Keynesian interventionism.
Keynes’s heresy was to deny that there are any such natural forces, at least in the short term. This was the point of his famous remark, “In the long run we are all dead.” Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time. To believe otherwise is to commit the “fallacy of composition.” What is true of the parts is not true of the whole. If all of Europe is cutting, the United Kingdom cannot grow; if the entire world is cutting, global growth will stop.
In these circumstances, austerity is exactly the opposite of what is needed. A government cannot liquidate its deficit if the source of its revenues, the national income, is diminishing. It is deficit reduction, not debt, that is profligate, because it implies wastage of available human and physical capital, quite apart from the resulting misery.
Austerity’s advocates rely on one – and only one – argument: If fiscal contraction is part of a credible “consolidation” program aimed at permanently reducing the share of government in GDP, business expectations will be so encouraged by the prospect of lower taxes and higher profits that the resulting economic expansion will more than offset the contraction in demand caused by cuts in public spending. The economist Paul Krugman calls this the “confidence fairy.”
The pro-austerity argument is pure assertion, but it is meant to be a testable assertion, so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends, the faster the economy will grow. Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
Economists arrived at some striking correlations. For example , “an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a 0.5-1% lower annual growth rate.” In April 2010, the leader of this school, Harvard University’s Alberto Alesina, assured European finance ministers that “even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run.”
But two fallacies vitiated the “proofs” offered by Alesina and others. First, because the cuts had to be “credible” – that is, large and decisive – the continuing absence of growth could be blamed on the insufficiency of the cuts. Thus, Europe’s failure to recover “immediately” has been due to a lack of austerity, even though public-sector retrenchment has been unprecedented.
Second, the researchers committed the arch-statistical mistake of confusing correlation with causation. If you find a correlation between deficit reduction and growth, the reduction could be causing the growth or vice versa. (Or both the deficit reduction and the growth could be due to something else – devaluation or higher exports, for example.)
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end. Going through the same material as Alesina had, its authors pointed out that “while it is plausible to conjecture that confidence effects have been at play in our sample of consolidations, during downturns they do not seem to have ever been strong enough to make the consolidations expansionary.” Fiscal contraction is contractionary, period.
An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%. This finding reflected the massive overweighting of one country in their sample, and there was the same confusion between correlation and causation seen in Alesina’s work: high debt levels may cause a lack of growth, or a lack of growth may cause high debt levels.
On this foundation of zombie economics and slipshod research rests the case for austerity. In fact, the austerity boosters in the UK and Europe frequently cited the Alesina and Reinhart/Rogoff findings.
The results of austerity have been what any Keynesian would have expected: hardly any growth in the UK and the eurozone in the last two and a half years, and huge declines in some countries; little reduction in public deficits, despite large spending cuts; and higher national debts.
Two other consequences of austerity are less appreciated. First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed. Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
So we will remain in a state of “under-employment equilibrium” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed (and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse). In the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely, statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice.

Security Trumps Justice in Upcoming Manning Trial
As the pretrial concludes, 'Aiding the Enemy' charge stands while prosecutors drop 'Reykjavik-13'
- Lauren McCauley, staff writer
Tuesday marked the final day in pretrial hearings in the court martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning. (Credit: Reuters)Prosecutors will proceed with the charge that Pfc. Bradley Manning "aided the enemy" when the trial of the alleged whistleblower commences next week.
Tuesday marked the final day of pretrial hearings in the court martial of Manning during which attorneys for both sides and Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over the trial, issued a series of revisions for the upcoming trial.
During the hearing, Manning accepted as a "stipulation of fact" that the government has evidence that Osama Bin Laden had taken a "close personal interest" in the WikiLeaks materials. This "fact" was illustrated through a series of letters between Bin Laden and a member of al-Qaida—one of which included the Afghanistan "war logs" that were among the WikiLeaks disclosures.
Further, Lind issued a ruling Tuesday that the prosecution could use classified documents "within limits" to attempt to prove that the material Manning transmitted to WikiLeaks was potentially damaging to US interests.
The issue on how best to handle classified information throughout the trial has spurred some debate and prompted a " dry run " session after which Lind concluded it was "not possible to elicit coherently nuanced" testimony on classified information in open court and thus decided to close portions of the trial, independent blogger Kevin Gosztola reports.
"The over-riding interest in protecting national security over-rides the risk of miscarriage of justice," said Lind, who also added that it over-rode Manning's First Amendment rights.
Most notably, during Tuesday's proceedings military lawyers announced they were dropping one of the charges against him and would no longer seek to prove the US soldier was guilty of leaking the state department cable, known as "Reykjavik-13," which reportedly demonstrates the US's "bullying tactics against Iceland to accept austerity measures in the wake of the global financial meltdown."
The Guardian's Ed Pilkington reports:
[Manning] has pleaded guilty to a lesser offence relating to the leak of Reykjavik-13 and liable to a maximum of two years. The US government had sought to press further statutory charges on him that would have added up to an additional eight years on his sentence, but has now dropped the count.
However, the change may be "limited in significance," Pilkington adds, in light of the more serious accusation of "aiding the enemy." If Manning is found guilty of "assisting Osama bin Laden by making public information that could injure the US," he faces a potential life sentence with no chance of parole.
Pilkington continues: 
Should Manning be found not guilty to having aided the enemy, he still faces a further 20 counts carrying an overall maximum sentence of more than 150 years. At a minimum, the soldier has already pleaded guilty to lesser charges, of prejudicing the good order and discipline of the military by leaking information, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
The trial, which begins on June 3, will be the most high-profile prosecution by the Obama administration of a leak of state secrets. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has authorized more prosecutions of whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined.

Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports .
Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. "She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course," the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times .
Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would "have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."
The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question .
Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.
Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name "tea party" or "patriot."
According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration , Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.
Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave "false or misleading information" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.
"The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions," Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. "Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing -- the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs."

This direct assault on our Constitution further justifies the American people’s distrust in government and its ability to properly implement our laws." (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

"The admission by the Obama administration that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political opponents echoes some of the most shameful abuses of government power in 20th-century American history.  Today, we are left with serious questions: who is ultimately responsible for this travesty?  What actions will the Obama administration take to hold them accountable?  And have other federal agencies used government powers to attack Americans for partisan reasons?  House Republicans have made oversight of federal agencies a top priority on behalf of the American people, and I applaud the work that members such as Charles Boustany, Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan have done to bring this issue to light. I also strongly support Sen. McConnell’s call for a transparent, government-wide review to ensure similar practices are not happening elsewhere in the federal bureaucracy," Boehner said in a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-statement-irs-targeting-conservative-groups" target="_blank">statement</a>.

(Photo: Elsewhere Films)"Citizen Koch," a documentary about money in politics focused on the Wisconsin uprising, was shunned by PBS for fear of offending billionaire industrialist David Koch, who has given $23 million to public television, according to  Jane Mayer of the  New Yorker . The dispute highlights the increasing role of private money in "public" television and raises even further concerns about the Kochs potentially purchasing eight major daily newspapers.
The film from Academy Award-nominated filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin documents how the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision helped pave the way for secret political spending by players like the Kochs,  who contributed directly and indirectly  to the election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in 2010 and  came to his aid again  when the battle broke out over his effort to limit collective bargaining. 
Originally slated to appear on PBS stations nationwide as part of the "Independent Lens" series, "Citizen Koch" had its funding pulled after David Koch was offended by another PBS documentary critical of the billionaire industrialists.
"People like the Kochs have worked for decades to undermine public funding for institutions like PBS," Deal told the Center for Media and Democracy. "When public dollars dry up, private dollars come in to make up for the shortfall."
And that private funding can conflict with PBS' "public" mission and its editorial integrity. The PBS distributor "backed out of the partnership because they came to fear the reaction our film would provoke," Deal and Lessin said in a statement. "David Koch, whose political activities are featured in the film, happens to be a public-television funder and a trustee of both [New York PBS member station] WNET and [Boston member station] WGBH. This wasn’t a failed negotiation or a divergence of visions; it was censorship, pure and simple.”
"Park Avenue" Documentary Raised Koch Hackles
In November of last year, the New York PBS affiliate WNET aired a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney, "Park Avenue," that explored growing income inequality by contrasting the lives of residents in a luxury apartment building in Manhattan with individuals living on the other end of Park Avenue, in the Bronx. The film focuses on one of the apartment's wealthiest residents, David Koch, and does not paint a particularly positive image of the billionaire industrialist and his brother, Charles.
Koch is also a board trustee and major donor to WNET. And WNET's president called him before the documentary aired to alert Koch to the critical content -- and took the nearly unprecedented step of airing a disclaimer from Koch following the film calling it "disappointing and divisive." WNET also replaced the original introduction to the film, which had been narrated by actor Stanley Tucci, with one calling the film "controversial" and "provocative." 
“They tried to undercut the credibility of the film, and I had no opportunity to defend it,” the film's director Gibney told Mayer. "Why is WNET offering Mr. Koch special favors?"
Independent Television Service (ITVS), an arm of PBS that funds and distributes independent films, had funded "Park Avenue," and aired it as part of ITVS' popular "Independent Lens" series that runs on dozens of PBS member stations. ITVS also funded "Citizen Koch" and it was also slated to be aired on the Independent Lens series. 
But "Citizen Koch" got caught in the blowback.
Fearing Koch Backlash, Funding Pulled on "Citizen Koch"
ITVS was excited about the "Citizen Koch" documentary before "Park Avenue" aired. In April 2012, the company informed Deal and Lessin their film would receive $150,000, and that “Everyone here at ITVS looks forward to working with you on your very exciting and promising program.”
But once "Park Avenue" aired, WNET blamed ITVS for impacting its relationship with David Koch and not providing advance notice of the film's contents. Mayer writes: 
"[WNET President Neal] Shapiro acknowledged that, in his conversations with ITVS officials about 'Park Avenue,' he was so livid that he threatened not to carry its films in the future. The New York metropolitan area is the largest audience for public television, so the threat posed a potentially mortal blow to ITVS."
ITVS got the message, and quickly changed its tune on "Citizen Koch."
Lessin and Deal began receiving pressure from ITVS executives to change the title and de-emphasize the Kochs' political influence. One executive told the filmmakers the title was "extremely problematic" and that “we live in a world where we have to be aware that people with power have power.”
On a conference call in January, ITVS executives acknowledged the push-back from WNET over the "Park Avenue" film, and again urged the filmmakers to change the storyline. Sources told Mayer that what their message was "Get rid of the Koch story line ... Because of the whole thing with the Koch brothers, ITVS knew WNET would never air it."
"It is always a struggle for documentaries to get out there," Deal told CMD. "That's why PBS and ITVS are so important: they support independent filmmakers to say new things on the public airwaves." But because of funding pressures, "we won't have access to that audience now," he said. "We're disappointed."
PBS Reaction to "Citizen Koch" Proved the Film's Point: Money Talks
"Citizen Koch," which premiered at Sundance in January and competed for Best Documentary, followed the activism and struggles of former Republicans who felt betrayed by Walker's union-busting move (which he never mentioned on the campaign trail). The film documents the role of Koch-funded entities like Americans for Prosperity, which spent  $10 million  aiding Walker in his recall election. The film's final scene shows an Americans for Prosperity official making the incredible claim the group is "just like the Red Cross, just like any other nonprofit.”
In April of this year, one day after the film had its Dairy State premiere at the Wisconsin Film Festival, ITVS informed Lessin and Deal it had "decided not to move forward with the project."
In a statement, the filmmakers said this is an ironic turn: “It’s the very thing our film is about—public servants bowing to pressures, direct or indirect, from high-dollar donors.”
"I don't believe there was a concerted conspiracy to keep 'Citizen Koch' off of public television, with David Koch as a ringleader," Deal told CMD. "Instead, Koch's presence and role in that world created an environment that was hostile to our message. And that was enough." 
Just before Mayer's New Yorker article was published, on May 16, David Koch resigned from WNET's board. The resignation was the result, a source told Mayer, "of his unwillingness to back a media organization that had so unsparingly covered its sponsor."
As has been widely reported , the Kochs are now considering a purchase of eight major daily newspapers currently owned by the Tribune Companies. And that has Deal worried. 
"For anybody who says the owner or funder of an outlet doesn't have an impact on what gets published, I hope they'll think again."

http://www.realfarmacy.com/monsanto-found-guilty-of-chemical-poisoning-in-landmark-case1/|Comments
A French farmer who can no longer perform his routine farming duties because of permanent pesticide injuries has had his day in court, literally, and the perpetrator of his injuries found guilty of chemical poisoning. The French court in Lyon ruled that Monsanto’s Lasso weedkiller formula, which contains the active ingredient alachlor, caused Paul Francois to develop lifelong neurological damage that manifests as persistent memory loss, headaches, and stuttering during speech.
Reports indicate that the 47-year-old farmer sued Monsanto back in 2004 after inhaling the Lasso product while cleaning his sprayer tank equipment. Not long after, Francois began experiencing lasting symptoms that prevented him from working, which he says were directly linked to exposure to the chemical. Since Lasso’s packaging did not bear adequate warnings about the dangers of exposure, Francois alleged at the time that Monsanto was essentially negligent in providing adequate protection for its customers.
To the surprise of many, the French court agreed with the claims and evidence presented before it, declaring earlier this year that “Monsanto is responsible for Paul Francois’ suffering after he inhaled the Lasso product … and must entirely compensate him.” The court is said to be seeking expert opinion on how to gauge Francois’ losses in order to determine precisely how much Monsanto will be required to compensate him in the case.
“It is a historic decision in so far as it is the first time that a (pesticide) maker is found guilty of such a poisoning,” said Francois Lafforgue, Paul Francois’ lawyer, to Reuters earlier in the year.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to alachlor can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, spleen, and eyes, and may lead to the development of anemia and even cancer. The EPA apparently views alachlor as so dangerous, in fact, that the agency has set the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) for alachlor to zero in order to “prevent potential health problems.” ( http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/alachlor.cfm )
In 2007, France officially banned Lasso from use in the country in accordance with a European Union (EU) directive enacted in 2006 prohibiting the chemical from further use on crops in any member countries. But despite all the evidence proving that alachlor can disrupt hormonal balance, induce reproductive or developmental problems, and cause cancer, the chemical is still being used on conventional crops throughout the U.S. to this very day. ( http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_ChemReg.jsp?Rec_Id=PC35160 )
“I am alive today, but part of the farming population is going to be sacrificed and is going to die because of (alachlor),” added Francois to Reuters.

By JOSHUA ROBERTS / joshr@laramieboomerang.com  Wednesday, May 15, 2013
Share
A Laramie woman’s appearance Monday morning in Albany County Circuit Court didn’t take place as previously scheduled.
Meg Lanker-Simons, cited for interfering with a peace officer in connection with a social media controversy last month, is next set for a scheduling conference at 8:30 a.m. June 13 in Circuit Court.
Her attorney, Charles Pelkey, entered an appearance on her behalf and a not guilty plea in late April to the misdemeanor charge.
The charge stems from a UW Police investigation into a graphic, sexually-threatening comment posted on the Facebook page, UW Crushes.
Lanker-Simons was allegedly targeted in the comment. However, UW Police allege Lanker-Simons authored the comment.
“Subject admitted to making a controversial post on UW Crushes webpage and then lied about not doing it,” according to the citation.
The interference charge isn’t Lanker-Simons’ first experience with the local court system.
Documents outline radio station incident
According to court records, she was charged in November 2005 in District Court with aggravated assault. 
Lanker-Simons, then Meghan Michelena, pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2006 as part of a plea agreement, records indicate.
According to an affidavit, the charge stemmed from an incident in which Lanker-Simons walked into an Albany County radio station she’d been fired from with a Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun.
She confronted a man who had decided to terminate her, the affidavit reports. The man also told her, the court documents state, that she would not be rehired.
Lanker-Simons “pulled a semi-automatic pistol from her purse, waved the firearm around and pointed (the) firearm at (the man),” according to the affidavit.
The man, according to the affidavit, said he was “in fear for his life.” 
The radio station, the affidavit states, was evacuated.
Albany County Sheriff’s Office deputies made contact with Lanker-Simons as she was attempting to leave the area in her vehicle and detained her at gunpoint.
During an interview with deputies, Lanker-Simons “admitted to having (a) gun in (her) purse and pulling it out and waving it around (the) victim,” according to the affidavit.
She was sentenced to six years of probation in July 2006. 
The probation sentence was subject to numerous stipulations, including refraining from owning firearms, undergoing counseling, paying fines and fees, completing community service and submitting letters of apology to victims.
Later in 2006, she pleaded no contest to an attempt to revoke her probation. 
Court documents state she violated probation by being “unsuccessfully discharged” from a residential treatment program.
In April 2007, she was again sentenced to probation with the stipulation she complete a treatment program in Utah.
Web page removed
Last week, an online page at www.wepay.com seeking donations for Lanker-Simons’ medical expenses was removed.
On the page, she wrote she was seeking “donations because emergency surgery to remove an appendix time bomb has left our budget stretched beyond the breaking point,” according to a narrative explaining the monetary request.
“We’re finding it impossible to cover medical bills, pay rent and utilities, buy groceries and though I’ve been looking for full-time work, it’s been difficult to find anyone who’s even hiring. My husband and I are both working and going to school, but it’s just not enough.”
Since she was cited in the UW Crushes controversy, Lanker-Simons has referred questions to her attorney.
Pelkey said the wepay.com request was posted in February and gained recent attention because of a right-wing blog.
“Certainly this case has gotten a lot of attention, and there are a lot of people with a lot of opinions on both sides,” he said last week. “And, I would imagine there are people out there who believe Ms. Lanker did what she’s accused of doing and disagree with her politics.
“The assertion is she’s using it to raise money for her defense fund and fraudulently claiming that she needs a procedure. She did need the medical procedure, she got the medical procedure (and) she used funds because she’s a low-income person and got assistance.”
The wepay.com page had raised at least $2,400 before it was taken down.
Pelkey said his client has a full accounting of the donations and receipts for her medical expenses.
“We’re all in the position of having major expenses, really, for a major medical condition and she came up with a unique way of raising funds for it,” he said.
“Basically, her life has always been an open book online.”
Lanker-Simons, according to UW, participated Saturday in the College of Arts and Sciences’ commencement ceremony. 
She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Police Tase Foreclosed Upon Homeowners Protesting Criminal Bankers, Criminal Bankers Continue Facing No Repercussions
Why shoot peaceful protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant?
Taser International's X2 two-shot Taser for law enforcement is displayed in January. The US Supreme Court refused to review the use of Taser stun guns by police on two women, including one who was seven months pregnant at the time.
May 21, 2013  |  
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
 
You may have heard about the protests at the DOJ by foreclosed upon homeowners demanding that Eric Holder prosecute some bankers for their criminal activity. If you haven't,  you can read all about it here.  
Unfortunately, I received reports last night that citizens exercising their right to peacefully protest were being casually tasered by the authorities. 
This came from my friend Jason Rosenbaum, who was there:
At the start of the action, when the protesters and homeowners arrived at the south entrance of the DOJ, we were greeted by half a dozen police in tactical gear or uniforms and a metal barrier cutting off access to a small courtyard in front of the large DOJ doors. The group of protesters rallied at the barrier and the planters next to it that made up the square and homeowners slowly climbed over the barriers in an attempt to gain an audience at the DOJ and register their complaints. At that point, the police were keeping people from climbing over, but eventually the police retreated and a few homeowners and protesters made it over and sat down to occupy that space. More joined them. After about 10 minutes, as more climbed over the barrier and the crowd occupied more space, the police retreated up the few steps leading to the door, and eventually ceded the square entirely by going inside the DOJ, leaving the protesters and homeowners alone in the square. The protesters took down the barriers at that point and everyone occupied the square, complete with signs, chants, couches, tents, and the like. (There's video/photos of this on my Twitter feed, @j_ro.)
That was phase one -- for the next phase, the protest split into three groups, with one staying at the south entrance and the two others to take entrances on the north and west sides of the building. I went with the group going to the west, and we were met again by police presence at the west entrance. We pushed on through to the north entrance around the block, and again were met by police. After sitting down there for a bit and taking the intersection down the block, we were notified that our brethren needed our help back at the south entrance and we marched over.
When I got there with the crowd in my group, the police had about a dozen homeowners in plastic cuffs on the south steps and had set up a police line around the original square in front of the door. The people in my group rushed through the line to sit down with their fellow protesters and homeowners being arrested, and it was at this point that at least one officer took out his taser gun, pulled the trigger, and started using it to push back those in the crowd coming to the support of those being arrested. That's what you see in my video. As Matt noted, it was over very quickly, with protesters looking to peacefully support those who were being arrested being tased and pushed back, and those being arrested led into a police van and driven away for processing.
At this point, as the arrests were being loaded into the van, another group of about a dozen sat down inside the police barrier and as far as I know they're still there (I had to leave about an hour after the initial arrests). So there may be more arrests to come shortly.
There is nothing new about protesters gathering at government buildings. And it has never been a problem for the police to arrest protesters in an orderly fashion, even when the protesters are not cooperating by sitting down and refusing to move. This is the way civil disobedience has worked for many a moon. 
Shooting protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant, however, is new. And it's completely unnecessary, not to mention contrary to our long tradition of peaceful protest. I thought this sort of thing went out with the use of firehoses and police dogs.
It happened again today, this time well captured on video:
 
Note the casual sadism. The young woman is surrounded by three men as she links arms with another protester. She does not appear to be in any way violent or threatening. The big man behind her holds her around the neck and whispers in her ear (who knows what he told her, but if it's the usual, he says "cooperate right now or you're going to be tased.") As a peaceful protester engaged in civil disobedience she naturally refuses. At this point, they would normally pick her up bodily and carry her to the paddy wagon. Instead, they hit her with 50,000 volts of electricity, she crumbles to the ground as her whole body is overwhelmed by pain. 
And then they blithely walk away, leaving her writhing on the ground. Let's just say they were lucky she wasn't one of the thousands of people who've died from tasers. I guess they would have noticed at some point when she stopped screaming. 
This makes me sick to my stomach. And that it happened on the steps of the United States Department of Justice makes me ashamed to be an American. 
The woman who was tasered is named Carmen Pittman.  Here's her story.  I guess she just hasn't been punished enough.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Patrick Leahy withdrew his proposed amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have recognized the marriages of same-sex couples for immigration purposes on Tuesday night, after several Democratic members of the committee stated that they would not be supporting it.
A little past 7 p.m., Leahy said, “It is with a heavy heart … I will withhold the Leahy Amendment 7 at this point.”
Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offered the amendment a half-hour earlier, saying, “I don’t want to be the senator who asks Americans to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country.”
He added, “Discriminating against people based on who they love is a travesty,” noting that he wanted to hear from members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators about why they didn’t include protections for gay couples in the initial bill.
Sen. Lindsey Graham went first, saying he opposed the inclusion of gay couples’ protections in the bill, despite noting his respect for Leahy’s “passion” is support of marriage equality.
“If you redefine marriage for immigration purposes [by the amendment], the bill would fall apart because the coalition would fall apart,” Graham said. “It would be a bridge too far.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein cited Graham’s comments, then, saying of Leahy’s amendment, “I think this sounds like the fairest approach, but here’s the problem … we know this is going to blow the agreement apart. I don’t want to blow this bill apart.”
She cited the fact that the Supreme Court could strike down the Defense of Marriage Act provision that prevents same-sex couples from having equal immigration rights in coming months. She also noted the a bill she is sponsoring to repeal DOMA is holding in the Senate, concluding, “I would just implore to hold up on this amendment at this time.”
Sen. Jeff Flake, another Republican in the Gang of Eight, said, “It certainly would mean this bill would not move forward.”
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic member of the Gang of Eight, then spoke up, praising Leahy’s leadership, but concluding, “I believe that this is the wrong moment, this is the wrong bill.”
Sen. Chuck Schumer went last of the four members of the Gang of Eight on the committee, saying, “This is one of the most excruciating decisions I have had to make in my [time] in Congress. … Not to do this is rank discrimination.”
He then said, however, of opponents of inclusion, “They’ve made it perfectly clear that if this provision is included … they will abandon [the bill.] … If we make the effort to add it to this bill, they will walk away. … The result: no equality, no immigration bill, everyone loses. … Much as it pains me, I cannot support this amendment if it will bring down the bill.’
“I will be here,” Schumer said to the LGBT community, to work on the issue in the future. “This is far from our last battle together.”
Sen. Al Franken, likewise, joined in the decision not to support the amendment, saying, “This is the definition of a Hobson’s choice. … It’s wrong to discriminate against people, but I do not want the LGBT people who would be hurt by this bill not passing, this whole bill not passing, to be hurt by this falling apart.”

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-20/how-to-humble-a-wing-nut.html|By Cass R. Sunstein
2013-05-20T22:00:02Z
There is no standard definition of the all-important term “wing nut,” so let’s provide one. A wing nut is someone who has a dogmatic commitment to an extreme political view (“wing”) that is false and at least a bit crazy (“nut”).
A wing nut might believe that George W. Bush is a fascist, that Barack Obama is a socialist, that big banks run the Department of the Treasury or that the U.S. intervened in Libya because of oil.
When wing nuts encounter people with whom they disagree, they immediately impugn their opponents’ motivations. Whatever their religion, they are devout Manicheans, dividing their fellow citizens into the forces of light and the forces of darkness.
Wing nuts have a lot of fellow travelers -- people who don’t fit the definition, yet who are similarly dogmatic and whose views, though not really crazy, aren’t exactly evidence-based. You can be a wing nut on a particular issue without being a wing nut in general. Most human beings can hear the voice, at least on occasion, of their inner wing nut.
The good news is that wing nuts usually don’t matter. The bad news is that they influence people who do. Sadly, more information often fails to correct people’s misunderstandings. In fact, it can backfire and entrench them. Can anything be done?
Stunning Conclusion
For a positive answer, consider an intriguing study by Philip Fernbach, a University of Colorado business school professor, and his colleagues. Their central finding is that if you ask people to explain exactly why they think as they do, they discover how much they don’t know -- and they become more humble and therefore more moderate.
The study came in four stages. First, people were asked to state their positions on a series of political issues, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, a national flat tax, merit-based pay for teachers and unilateral sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. They were asked to describe their position on a seven-point scale whose endpoints were “strongly in favor” and “strongly opposed.”
Second, people were asked to rate their degree of understanding of each issue on a seven-point scale. The third step was the crucial one; they were asked to “describe all the details you know about [for example, the impact of instituting a ‘cap and trade’ system for carbon emissions ], going from the first step to the last, and providing the causal connection between the steps.” Fourth, people were asked to rerate their understanding on the seven-point scale and to restate their position on the relevant issue.
The results were stunning. On every issue, the result of requesting an explanation was to persuade people to give a lower rating of their own understanding -- and to offer a more moderate view on each issue. In a follow-up experiment, Fernbach and his co-authors found that after being asked to explain their views, people were less likely to want to give a bonus payment to a relevant advocacy group.
Interestingly, Fernbach and his co-authors found no increase in moderation when they asked people not to “describe all the details you know” about the likely effects of the various proposals, but simply to say why they believe what they do. If you ask people to give reasons for their beliefs, they tend to act as their own lawyers or public relations managers, and they don’t move toward greater moderation. The lesson is subtle: What produces an increase in humility, and hence moderation, is a request for an explanation of the causal mechanisms that underlie people’s beliefs.
Motivated Reasoning
In an unnoticed essay, the economist Albert Hirschman lamented the “overproduction of opinionated opinion.” He feared that strong opinions, as such, “might be dangerous to the health of our democracy,” because they can make it harder for people to understand one another and to find mutually agreeable solutions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are to be believed, the problem is curable -- at least if those who have “opinionated opinions” have less than solid foundations for their beliefs and if they can be convinced of that fact.
For wing nuts and their many fellow travelers, however, there is a serious obstacle, and it goes by the name of “motivated reasoning.” When people have a strong emotional attachment to their initial convictions, they tend to heap ridicule on anything that runs counter to those convictions and to give a lot of weight to anything that supports them.
Motivated reasoning helps to account for two defining characteristics of wing nuts and their fellow travelers: a readiness to attack people’s good faith, rather than their actual arguments, and an eagerness to make the worst, rather than the best, of opposing positions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are right, this obstacle may not be insuperable. Serious efforts to examine the assumptions behind your own beliefs, and to identify what you don’t know, are likely to produce an increase in humility. Whether or not you change your view, you may well be humbled -- and end up being a bit more charitable to those who see things differently.

WASHINGTON | Tue May 21, 2013 5:50pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid expressions of horror, grief and resolve over the devastating tornado that smashed into suburban Oklahoma City, many lawmakers expressed relief on Tuesday that they took action in January to bulk up the FEMA disaster relief fund.
But Oklahoma's two senators, both Republicans, found themselves in an awkward position for having voted against the $60 billion supplemental appropriation bill that was largely aimed at providing relief to victims of Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into coastal New York and New Jersey last year.
The bill left the disaster fund run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a healthy balance of $11.6 billion. FEMA spokesman Dan Watson said the amount is sufficient for handling immediate response and recovery efforts in Oklahoma and residual recovery costs associated with Sandy.
In January, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe called the Sandy appropriations bill a "slush fund" because it included long-term infrastructure spending and funding for projects aimed at disasters other than the devastation along the U.S. East Coast.
The measure became embroiled in a tense budget fight over the "fiscal cliff" tax hikes in January and was delayed for several weeks for tempers to cool as FEMA's disaster fund rapidly dwindled.
On Tuesday, a day after a 2-mile (3-km) -wide tornado wiped out whole blocks of homes, killed at least 24 people and left thousands homeless in Moore, Oklahoma, Inhofe vowed that Oklahomans in need would not abuse federal disaster aid, as he said had occurred in the aftermath of Sandy.
"That's totally different," Inhofe told cable TV network MSNBC. "Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in Oklahoma."
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who also opposed the Sandy appropriation because it was not offset with budget savings elsewhere, pledged to make a similar "pay-for" demand if further disaster funds were needed. For now, however, he was focused on getting aid to the victims.
"As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I can assure Oklahomans that any and all available aid will be delivered without delay," Coburn said in a statement.
Representative Tom Cole, the Republican congressman whose district bore the brunt of the tornado - its second major disaster due to a twister in 14 years - had no explaining to do. He supported the Sandy legislation and pledged whatever resources were necessary to recover and rebuild devastated communities.
Cole, a moderate Republican with a reputation as a pragmatist, earned notoriety during the budget talks late last year as the first member of his party to advocate allowing higher tax rates on the wealthy in order to prevent tax increases on the vast majority of Americans.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he also helped trim some provisions from the Sandy bill that were unrelated to that disaster.
"I am confident we will get the help we need to make it through this tragedy. That is what Americans do for other Americans in tough times and challenging circumstances," Cole said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski, also a Democrat, both pledged that if more money was needed for Oklahoma City, they would take action to fund it.
"This is a time for neighbor helping neighbor. This is not the time for a 'budgeteering' battle. This is a time to respond with compassion and competence," Mikulski of Maryland said in a statement.

Budget request calls for $200m to go towards military construction to upgrade temporary facilities at the prison.
Last Modified: 22 May 2013 00:07
Since his inauguration in January 2009, US President Barack Obama has pushed for shutting the prison [AFP]
The Pentagon is asking Congress for more than $450 million for maintaining and upgrading the Guantanamo Bay prison that President Barack Obama wants to close.
New details on the administration's budget request emerged on Tuesday and underscored the contradiction of the president waging a political fight to shutter the facility while the military calculates the financial requirements to keep the installation operating, AP news agency reported.
The budget request for the fiscal year beginning October 1 calls for $79m for detention operations, the same as the current year, and $20.5m for the office of military commissions, an increase over the current amount of $12.6m. The request also includes $40m for a fiber optic cable and $99 million for operation and maintenance.
The Pentagon also wants $200m for military construction to upgrade temporary facilities. That work could take eight to 10 years as the military has to transport workers to the island, rely on limited housing and fly in building material.
The facility at the US naval base in Cuba currently holds 166 prisoners, and hunger strikes by 100 of them over their indefinite detention and prison conditions prompted Obama to renew his effort to close Guantanamo.
'Not necessary'
The president is expected to discuss the future of the facility in a speech on counterterrorism on Thursday.
"Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe," the president said at a White House news conference last month. "It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."
Since his inauguration in January 2009, Obama has pushed for shutting the prison, signing an executive order for closure during his first week in office. He has faced resistance in Congress with Republicans and some Democrats repeatedly blocking efforts to transfer terror suspects to the United States.
The law that Congress passed and Obama signed in March to keep the government running includes a longstanding provision that prohibits any money for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States or its
territories. It also bars spending to overhaul any US facility in the US to house detainees.

Siena, Italy—Here’s a modest idea to break the gridlock, the stupidity, the meanness, the partisan lying and irresponsible ineffectiveness of modern Washington. We should consider returning to the Middle Ages.
Siena today is a small city of about 50,000 people, not much bigger than it was at its peak in the late 13th century. In those good and bad old days, it was a major manufacturing, mostly wool, and commercial center in Tuscany. The bad things were the Black Death—the plague of 1348, which wiped out more than its inhabitants, reducing it to a population that might have been as low as 16,000—and its repression by a larger neighbor, Florence. The good thing was that it was prevented from growing by those great troubles. Because of losing its struggles with its northern neighbor, much of Siena is still a beautiful and preserved city of the 14th century.
The other good and interesting thing about the city is how it was governed from 1277 to 1355. The largest building on the city’s spectacular oval Piazza del Campo, then and now, is the Palazzo Pubblico, were the city was governed by the "Nove," nine men selected by lottery and locked in the palace for two months at a time.
The idea: to keep away outsiders and outside influences—we call them special interests, lobbies and lawyers—as the "councillors" debated the problems and future of their city and then wrote its laws. The motives: to reduce the power of the Catholic Church, the richest institution in the area, and the power of aristocrats, members of the 56 families exercising military and commercial power.
One of the rooms in the palace, the "Sala della Pace," the room of peace, where the nine gathered, was decorated by murals—still visible today—showing dramatic instances of good and evil in government. The "Good Government" paintings show peace, prosperity and the virtues of Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, Prudence and Magnanimity—and, of course, Faith, Hope and Charity.

The "Bad Government" paintings show murder in the streets, soldiers carrying away women, and Justice bound in the chains of Tyranny.
Looked good to me. Unfortunately, the Council of Nine was overthrown by aristocrats and soldiers of Florence, who blamed the Nine for the plague destroying the city.
So where are we today in Washington? What will people hundreds of years from now think of our national governance with all its blaming, nastiness and negativity? It looks as if our country is being run by thugs and liars motivated by revenge and pettiness beyond description.
Our leaders are obsessed, it seems, with peripheral "scandals" and misjudgments, public relations arguments, talking points and plain old nonsense. A relevant critique of the current state of affairs in the IRS "scandal" was published a week or so ago by Michael Hiltzik, the economic columnist of the Los Angeles Times:
"It’s strange how ‘scandal’ gets defined these days in Washington. At the moment, everyone is screaming about the ‘scandal’ of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.
"Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.
"The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations."
I’m with him. Lock up the leaders of our Republic and force them to deal with real issues—and with each other.

The Obama Justice Department has seized the phone records of numbers that are associated with White House staffers and, apparently, with Fox News reporters, according to a document filed in the case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, on October 13, 2011. Kim is a former State Department contractor accused of violating the Espionage Act for allegedly leaking classified information to James Rosen, a Fox News reporter. Ronald C. Machen, Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is prosecuting the case, has seized records associated with two phone numbers at the White House, at least five numbers associated with Fox News, and one that has the same area code and exchange as Rosen’s personal-cell-phone number (the last four numbers are redacted).
In all, Ronald C. Machen, Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has seized records associated with over thirty different phone numbers. In the filing that included the new information, the last four digits of each telephone line targeted by the Obama Administration are redacted. Two of the numbers begin with area code 202 and the exchange 456, which, according to current and former Administration officials, are used exclusively by the White House. (The phone number for the White House switchboard is (202) 456-1414.)
At least five other numbers targeted by the government include the area code 202 and the exchange 824. The phone number for the Fox News Washington bureau, which is publicly available, is (202) 824-0001. Rosen’s work phone number at Fox News begins with the same area code and exchange.
William Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney, told The New Yorker this afternoon, “Because that information is sealed, I can’t confirm the owner or subscriber for any of those records.” Asked if the phone numbers of any reporters had been targeted in the Kim investigation, Miller said he could not comment.
Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that, as part of the investigation of the Kim leak, Obama’s Department of Justice seized e-mails from Rosen’s personal Gmail account . In the search warrant for that request, the government described Rosen as “an aider, and abettor, and / or co-conspirator” in violating the Espionage Act, noting that the crime can be punished by ten years in prison. Rosen was not indicted in the case, but the suggestion in a government document that a reporter could be guilty of espionage for engaging in routine reporting is unprecedented and has alarmed many journalists and civil libertarians.
The document uncovered today suggests the government seized “call detail” records from Rosen’s work and cell phones, which would show whom he called, who called him, how long they spoke, and the times of the calls. The document suggests that the government was seeking only the subscriber records for the two White House numbers targeted, information that a government source said would include the name of the official who used the specific line.
Because the last four digits of each phone number are redacted in the government filing, it is impossible to determine who exactly was targeted by the Justice Department.
Here is the full list of the phone numbers included in the filing, which lists evidence that the prosecution was sharing with the defense:
(202) 506 (Comcast)
(202) 777 (ATT)
(212) 601 (ATT) ( According to NewsCorp , the main number for the Fox Business Channel is (212) 601-7000.)
(202) 549 (ATT Wireless) (Rosen’s cell phone begins with these digits.)
(202) 615 (ATT)
(202) 213 (ATT Wireless)
(202) 213 (TracFone)
(202) 824 (The main number for Fox News’s Washington bureau is (202) 824-0001 and Rosen’s work line starts with these six digits.)
(202) 861 (Verizon) (Time uses this area code and exchange, but so do other unrelated entities.)
(202) 883 (Verizon)

http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/politics/anthony-weiner-mayoral-campaign/index.html|Disgraced ex-congressman Weiner says he's running for NYC mayor
From Alison Harding, CNN
updated 1:44 AM EDT, Wed May 22, 2013
(CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner is running for New York City mayor, he announced Wednesday morning in a video posted on his campaign website .
"Look, I've made some big mistakes and I know I've let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons," Weiner said in the video. "I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it for my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."
Weiner plotting a political comeback?
Now that Weiner is in the race, the Democrat will undoubtedly face questions from voters and fellow candidates about the 2011 scandal that eventually led to his resignation from Congress.
His political career was derailed after he was found sending lewd photos and messages to multiple women. At first he lied, claiming his Twitter was hacked, but he later admitted to the indiscretions and left the House of Representatives.

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/21/a-mileage-tax-for-all-n-j-drivers-with-help-from-big-brother-it-could-happen/|Separated At Birth
UNION, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — It’s a controversial proposal: Paying for every mile you drive to cover road repairs.
While some say it’s necessary, others are saying it’s time to put the brakes on the idea, CBS 2’s Christine Sloan reported Tuesday.
It’s the one thing New Jersey can boast about – having the fourth-lowest gas tax in the nation . The money goes into the state’s transportation trust fund, paying for roads and bridges.
But what if you learned the fund is $14.3 billion in debt, and the gas tax just covers a yearly $991 million debt payment?
“The problem there is because previous administrations and legislatures raided the transportation trust fund to use that money in general funds,” said Sal Risalvato of the New Jersey Gasoline Convenience Automotive Association .
It’s what prompted the bill to repeal the gas tax and have residents pay for every mile they drive, so cars that don’t use gasoline or get better mileage pay for roads, too.
“How are you going to track that?” one driver wondered.
It turns out, with a GPS device. The concern was about big brother watching, so after opposition, the sponsor of the legislation this week amended the bill to only tax electric and compressed natural gas-powered car owners with a yearly $50 fee.
“They’re using the same roads everyone else is so they should pay the same tax,” said Susan Berowitz of Mountainside.
“Why should they be penalized for helping the environment?” added Danielle Morse of Union.
The Sierra Club agrees, with director Jeff Tittel saying, “We try to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars but now this is a disincentive.”
He said raise the gas tax. But with federal incentives to make fuel-efficient cars, Risalvato said there could be a mileage tax.
“Someday this could be the means,” Risalvato said.
Risalvato said some insurance companies are using mileage tracking devices and car manufacturers could build them into cars.
The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Jim Whelan told CBS 2 that while he is for fuel-efficient cars, $50 isn’t much money when you can afford to buy a car that cost more than $40,000. Hybrid cars are exempt in his bill. Two other states have vehicle mileage tax laws, Washington and Virginia.

CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson said on Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been "compromised" for over two years.
Attkisson told a local Philadelphia radio station that she has been working with investigators to discover the source of the activity.
"There has been an issue in my house and there has been an issue with my computers that's gone on for quite a long time that we're looking into," she said.
Attkisson has long been a thorn in the side of the White House, and a hero to conservatives, for her aggressive reporting on the incident in Benghazi and on the "Fast and Furious" controversy.
In 2011, she made waves when she claimed that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting on "Fast and Furious."
Host Chris Stigall asked if Attkisson thought that she had been the victim of a government operation, as the Associated Press and Fox News' James Rosen were . Attkisson was careful not to make any specific allegations about who had been targeting her, but she said it was possible there was a connection.
"I think there could be some relationship between these types of things and what happened to me," she said, adding that something suspicious had been happening since "at least February of 2011 and I think probably a significant period of time before that."
UPDATE: A spokesperson for CBS News told HuffPost's Michael Calderone, "We are investigating the matter."

We produce enough of oil not to have to import it from other places. If you look at the cost of gas in top oil producing countries in the world they only pay a small fraction for oil compared to us. Of course we consume a lot more than then they do but the reason we pay so much more is because a large portion of oil that we produce is exported to other countries. Does that make any sense to you? OIl companies take American oil, sell it to other countries for big﻿ profit and then charge us more.

10 Amazing Charts That Demonstrate The Slow, Agonizing Death Of The American Worker
By Michael, on May 16th, 2013
The middle class American worker is in danger of becoming an endangered species.  The politicians are not telling you the truth, and the mainstream media is certainly not telling you the truth, but the reality is that there is nothing but bad news on the horizon for workers in the United States.  In the old days, when the big corporations that dominate our society did well, that also meant good things for American workers since those corporations would need more of us to work for them.  But in the emerging one world economic system that our economy is being merged into, those corporations have other choices now.  For instance, the big corporations can now choose to limit the number of "expensive" American workers that they employ by shipping millions of jobs to the other side of the world .  And from their perspective, it makes perfect sense.  They can make much bigger profits by hiring people on the other side of the planet to work for them for less than a dollar an hour.  If they can get good production out of those people, then why should they hire Americans for ten to twenty times as much, plus have to give those Americans health insurance and other benefits?  Another major factor in the slow, agonizing death of the American worker is technology.  We live during a period when technology is advancing at a pace that is almost unimaginable at the same time that it is steadily becoming cheaper and cheaper.  That means that it is going to become easier and easier for companies to replace workers with robots and computers.  As I have written about previously , it is being projected that our economy will lose millions of jobs to technology in the coming years.  Yes, some of us will still be needed to help build the robots and the computers, but not all of us will.  And of course the overall general weakness of the economy is not helping matters either.  The American people inherited the greatest economic machine in the history of the world, and we have wrecked it.  Decades of very foolish decisions have resulted in the period of steady economic decline that we are experiencing now.
America is simply not the economic powerhouse that it once was.  Back in 2001, the U.S. economy accounted for 31.8 percent of global GDP.  By 2011, the U.S. economy only accounted for 21.6 percent of global GDP.  That is a collapse any way that you want to look at it.
Today, American workers are living in an economy that is rapidly declining, and their jobs are steadily being stolen by robots, computers and foreign workers that live in countries where it is legal to pay slave labor wages.  Politicians from both political parties refuse to do anything to stop the bleeding because they think that the status quo is working just great.
So don't expect things to get better any time soon.
The following are 10 amazing charts that demonstrate the slow, agonizing death of the American worker...
#1 Wages And Salaries As A Percentage Of GDP
As you can see, wages as a percentage of GDP are hovering near an all-time record low.  That means that American workers are bringing home a smaller share of the economic pie than ever before.
#2 Average Annual Hours Worked Per Employed Person In The United States
We are an economy that is rapidly trading good paying full-time jobs for low paying part-time jobs.  The decline in average annual hours worked that we have witnessed represents the equivalent of losing millions of jobs.  There has been an explosion of " the working poor " in the United States, and this trend is probably only going to accelerate in the years to come.
#3 Manufacturing Employment
As you can see, there are less Americans working in manufacturing today than there was in 1950 even though the population of the country has more than doubled since then.  The United States has lost more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities since 2001, and yet our politicians stand around and do nothing about it.
#4 Employment-Population Ratio
This is one of my favorite charts.  It shows that there has been absolutely no employment recovery at all since the end of the last recession.  The percentage of working age Americans that have a job has stayed under 59 percent for 44 months in a row.  How much worse will things get when the next major economic downturn strikes?
#5 Labor Force Participation Rate
This is how the Obama administration is getting the "unemployment rate" to magically go down.  They are pretending that millions upon millions of Americans simply do not want to work anymore.  As you will notice, the decline of the labor force participation rate has accelerated greatly since Barack Obama entered the White House.
#6 Duration Of Unemployment
The average amount of time that it takes an unemployed worker to find a new job has declined slightly, but it is still far above normal historical levels.  It is a crying shame that it takes the average unemployed worker two-thirds of a year to find a new job, but this is the new economic reality that we are all living in.
#7 Delinquency Rate On Residential Mortgages
Since there are not enough jobs for all of us, and since our wages are not rising as rapidly as the cost of living is, a whole bunch of us are falling behind on our mortgages.  As you can see, the mortgage delinquency rate has only dropped slightly and is still way, way above typical levels.
#8 New Homes Sold
American workers also don't have enough money to go out and buy new homes either.  Yes, new home sales have rebounded slightly this year, but we are nowhere near where we used to be.
#9 Consumer Credit
Millions of American families continue to resort to going into debt in a desperate attempt to make ends meet.  After a slight interruption during the last recession, consumer credit once again is growing at a frightening pace.
#10 Self-Employment At A Record Low
Since there aren't enough jobs for everyone, why aren't more Americans trying to start their own businesses?  Well, the reality of the matter is that the government has made it exceedingly difficult to start your own business today.  Taxes, rules, regulations and red tape are choking the life out of millions of small businesses in the United States.  As a result, the percentage of self-employed Americans is at a record low .
As all of these long-term trends continue, the middle class will continue to shrink, poverty in America will continue to explode and government dependence will continue to rise.
The numbers don't lie.  Today, the number of Americans on Social Security Disability now exceeds the entire population of Greece , and the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the entire population of Spain .
We are in the midst of a horrifying economic collapse, and the next major wave of that collapse is rapidly approaching.
Are you ready?

You’d probably be too weak from starvation to escape. Just kidding. I don’t know if it will get to the point where we’re taken to internment camps. I certainly hope it doesn’t get that bad. But it has happened in past. There is a book that everyone should read. It’s called “The Real Lincoln: A Second Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda and an Unnecessary War” by Tom DiLorenzo. Lincoln actually had political opponents imprisoned. The book was a real eye-opener for me in that what I was taught in the public school system was mostly fiction.

Two more good books to read: “The Naked Capitalist,” by W. Cleon Skousen. (130 pages, a short commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley’s book  (1300 pages)”Tragedy and Hope. A History of The World In Our Time.”
The second book: “Fahrenheit 451″ by Ray Bradbury, another very short book.

This is your main problem I think: way too much fiction
dancingontheheadofapin
I don’t have a problem, “Your Mama.” If you know how to read, I would advise you to get your head out of the sand and read not only the books I listed, but also George Orwell’s “1984″ and “Behold A Pale Horse” by William Cooper.  Cooper was murdered for exposing the government by writing and publishing this book.  Do a search for William Cooper or go to You Tube to see some of his videos.  The two books I listed in my previous comment are short books, so for those with a short attention span they will be fine.  If you want to really understand what is going on read the two in this comment.  Orwell’s book was thought of as fiction when it was written because no one believed it could happen.  Do  yourself a favor and get educated.

Read not the written word of mankind??  What about the Bible??  If we do not know history, we are doomed to repeat it.  Before written history was oral history, which was handed down from generation to generation. Some of the books of the Bible were written many years after Christ left this earth.  Those histories were passed down.  How would anyone know about anything beyond their own sphere of existence of the nation and the world unless there was communication?  Observation is subjective as is most communication.  Learn from it and then make decisions based on common sense.

All it takes is for OPEC to dump the dollar for something else(petro-dollars) and its Game Over. China could trigger that very easily and simply: just plain stop buying our debt. This would cause inflation to more than likely start rising at an uncontrolled rate(not quite Hyper, but close), which would cause OPEC to start looking at something else, and then our problems would multiply as the rest of the world would then start buying oil with some other form of currency and the dollars start flying back home. I actually hope this happens, the sooner the better, as  it would usher in a real recovery sooner instead of this miserable existence that we live in now….
Midwesterner
I mostly agree with you except China has already stopped buying our debt, that is why the FED stepped in to buy it, no one else wants it. As far as consequences of OPEC exiting from the US Petro Dollar, absolutely correct but Iraq and Libya tried that and we know what happened to them. Iran sells its oil for gold, not Dollars, which puts them on the radar too. As long as the most powerful military in the world is backing the Petro Dollar, they will be able to keep the game going.
MeMadMax
Incorrect, china is still buying debt, they have to unless/until the yen gets a good foothold. The segment that has stopped buying our debt is the personal type, as in individuals/small groups and the like. Although you would be correct in saying the Fed is buying the bulk of the debt however. And the opec deal all falls on saudi arabia, I think they will  pull the trigger after they get a nuke. They are actively shopping for one(and not hiding it), along with Bahrain.
Your mama
Really? You don’t think the bush gang has given their boyfriends in S.A. a few nukes by now?
MeMadMax
Nope. They would advertise the fact directly to Iran by now.
MeMadMax
Ugg, I mean Saudi Arabia will pull the plug on the dollar once they get their hands on a nuke AND a stronger currency takes hold. In that case, a nuke would be an insurance policy for doing whatever they want without worries of attack either from Iran the US or anyone.

they have several nukes thats why they did not receive scud missile attacks during gulf two

mmm, no. Saddam lost most of his scuds during the first gulf war. There were hunter killer parties of Apache helicopters that destroyed most of them, hundreds of them… When gulf war 2 happened, patriot missile was on the scene and reliable, you also had the 5th fleet stationed 24/7/365…

The first Russian task force docked in Cypress today. First time since USSR collapsed, that elements of the Russian pacific fleet have entered the Med.

Contradiction. The increased number of women in the workforce quadrupled from the Rush Limbaugh era of the 1950s. A majority of middle class women are making more money than ever before in history, more women are in top position jobs and more women are enrolling in college.
The visible minorities are the marginalised groups, but affirmative action will increase the job prospects for the visible minorities in America.
Syrin
You’re kidding right?   You know WHY more women are in the work force?   Look at that graph showing wages.    They HAVE to be.   Affirmative Action is why we have the worst president in history occupying the WHite House.    Affirmative Action forces employers to hire unqualified people at above market salaries, and they can’t fire them because minorities are no longer protected classes, they are privileged.
Angela
That is racist. Diversity is our strength. Diversity is good. FYI, if it wasn’t for affirmative action, I would have been neglected for hiring. Because I am a girl, I face discrimination in the patriarchal society. Did you know that a woman earns 45% less than an average white man working the same job?
Syrin
Diversity is not good.   Multi-culturalism has proven to be a failed experiment leading to violence.
Read and learn.   Stop blaming men for your problems: “Generally, women value relationships more than their careers or money, enter and leave the work force at a much higher rate, work part-time at a much higher rate, and work in professions with much lower compensation. As he explains in his book,Why Men Earn More, nearly all of it boils down to differences in occupation, and men overwhelmingly dominate jobs that
are in an unpleasant environment (sanitation vs. child care)
require harder-to-attain skills (physics vs. philosophy)
require longer work hours
demand financial risk (entrepreneur vs. teaching)
are inconvenient (i.e., relocation)
are hazardous (construction vs. librarian)
Due to the simple laws of supply and demand, these occupations pay more and contribute immensely to the pay gap. But again, government statistics completely neglect occupation — making a raw comparison of all working men and women instead (e.g., the female receptionist is lumped in with the $21,000/hr Lebron James and little-guy Michael Moore).
Wage gap statistics also do not account for time commitment. On average, women work far less than men because they choose to have much more balance in their lives. A study by the Center for Policy Alternatives and Lifetime Television found that nearly 85 percent of women took advantage of flexible work arrangements offered by their employers. And a decade after graduating college, 39 percent of women leave the work force or work part-time, versus 3 percent of men. Aside from the obvious benefits of working longer, workers who average 44 or more hours per week earn approximately 100 percent more than workers who average 40 hours.”

Here’s an example of discrimination against a woman brought to you by the PC affirmative action police in Philadelphia. A trilingual college-educated Hispanic/Uruguayan woman I know applied for a job with the city, which was enthusiastic when they saw her Spanish name but quickly lost their enthusiasm when they saw  that she was a WHITE Hispanic woman. The idiot affirmative action Democraps couldn’t wrap their racist heads around the fact that a woman could be both white and Hispanic. She didn’t fit their narrow view of what a Hispanic woman is supposed to look like. So much for “diversity.”
Conclusion: some of the worst bigots are government Democraps who support affirmative action quotas.
https://www.facebook.com/beth.s.owens1?ref=tn_tnmn Beth
45%? Perhaps in some instances but not as a whole. Refresh your research. And you only face discrimination in a patriarchal society because you believe you do. Get rid of that chip on your shoulder; believe in yourself and remember the wise words of Eleanor Rossevelt–”No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”.

wow…where did all these new people come from? Felicia, Tracy, you sound like you had just plagiarized a Sociology textbook. I think you are missing the whole point of this article (as well as the stats) in that our jobs and productivity have been shipped offshore and we are simply living on a falsely inflated economy and borrowed time. “Affirmative Action” is just so much more politically correct mumbo jumbo that actually punishes companies and employers rather than helping the marginalized in attaining opportunity. The problem with so many ideas set forth by….well, idealists–is that they SOUND all good but in all reality we DON’T live in a Utopian world; MLK’s dream is great for inspiration but the reality of such dreams will always fall short.
Tracy, you post about the future of our next generations being in the hands of todays girls (loose quote, sorry) is a scary and sobering thought. So many young people are caught up in what I call the “Matrix”, an unreal technological world unattached from down to Earth reality; a narcissistic generation that cannot live without constant input, affirmation, attention, etc. from their peers. So many  young people have NO real life skills WHATSOEVER. How IS this next generation going to function? Are they going to go to college, get a government job (pretty soon it looks like all jobs are going to be government jobs) pay other people to cook, clean, and raise their children? Already happening. I am almost 50 years old, I’ve seen a lot and the world change so very much in my life; but I can assure you the best thing you can give to your children/the next generation is STABILITY. Not a $400 phone, not the best day care ever, not the best labels out there, but the stability, love and encouragement of parents/caretakers that are totally committed to the upbringing of their young.

I’m not exactly a feminist, but I’m not patriarchal either. No particular bias,  my POV comes from real life and observation. Stats are just horrible for children raised in fatherless homes.
When our kids were young, we chose to live SIMPLY in order to give to them stability.
Roseof13
The mental, spiritual and emotional health of future generations is directly related to the amount of time, care and input they enjoy from wise women who understand that a woman does not need to compete with a man and raising a family is the highest art.
Equal does not mean same. We are not the same, but we are equal in terms of honour we deserve for doing that which is our main purpose and mission.
A full time mother is a physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, healer, artist, spiritual leader, etc, etc..
Opportunities for further learning and sharing abound in a women’s realm.
What happens to the children who are being raised by the internet, TV and their peers?
Are we better off after this drive for women to prove their equality by competing in the realm of career?
Men need to honor and respect our realm and both men and women need to come together and learn (or re-learn) how to have peace in our homes.
Craig
Good point Roseof13…..The economy is going down, jobs are being lost by the tens of thousands and the only solution given from these radical feminists is they should get jobs :-/ Radical feminists are a bunch of whining, entitled and spoiled women who can’t find a decent man and when the thugs and dunces wear out their bodies, the feminists spew hatred all over the place like the stuff squirted on their face in the rave parties.
El Pollo de Oro
Craig: Tom Leykis has had a lot to say about the type of bitches you describe. When they’re still attractive, they waste their youth on every type of loser, reprobate and scumbag they can get their hands on (or as you put it, “thugs and dunces”). But when their youth and looks gone are gone and they are 50 or 60 pounds overweight (all that boozing, binge eating and cigarette smoking takes it toll), they want a decent, responsible guy to support them financially. They go from spreading their legs for drug addicts and sociopaths to saying that they won’t date any guy who makes under 100K (as if a guy who makes that kind of money wants to date a frumpy, obese bitch in sweatpants).

You do realize that white women are minorities as well right? See, you’re the racist because you actually blame black people for something that white people created in the first place. Affirmative action benefited white women more so than black women and men. Also, affirmative action did not cause Obama to be president. Interesting, Obama is half white (bi-racial) and yet, you call him black. You don’t claim his white side from his mother. Interesting racist you are. When I think of worst president, Ronald Regan qualify because he created the private prisons and expanded the “war on drugs”.

We are all of us, evil.
Eve was deceived but Adam disobedient.  Women can be saved from this stigma of leading the human race to sin and death, only through repentance in Christ,… and then even more hope for some of those sisters – rearing godly children in the Lord.
The fall came to mankind by Eve’s actions and so the Lord incarnates himself in the virgin Mary’s womb to make the ultimate sacrifice for sin – once and forever, but not for all sinners.
This incarnation of God to be the God Man, is Jesus, who came that he would destroy the works of the devil.
Sisters in the meetings of the saints are wearing head coverings  You don’t see the men complaining about that.
The man God created first then the woman, and she out from the man.  The woman was to help and be one with the man. Not the other way around.  The genders are different by design.  The order of creation is dripping with meaning.
In a godless society like ours, the culture wants to blur these distinctions in the name of worldly equality and pay.
Just remember – the female, the bible says, are more fragile and instructs Christian men to dwell with them in understanding.
Perfection is but a foretaste in this life but wait until His kingdom is manifested in all of it’s glory.

America is losing jobs and families are being destabilised because of the economy.
Feminists can no longer contribute anything meaningful to society. It’s like society rewards the deviant people and punish the ambitious Americans who uphold family values. I don’t mean to sound sexist or homophobic but the inconvenient truth is that someone in the upper echelons of politics and business is trying to destroy the family unit.
Arguing with a feminist is like arguing about religion. It leads to nowhere and leaves a lot of bitterness.

Fast and Furious/Benghazi investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson: Something fishy’s been going on with my computers since early 2011
posted at 10:41 am on May 21, 2013 by Allahpundit
Via the Chris Stigall Show and WPHT in Philadelphia. Two weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been worth posting; Attkisson herself, I suspect, wouldn’t have mentioned it publicly. Even if she’s right about something fishy going on, there are other plausible culprits besides the U.S. government when it comes to reporters’ computers being infiltrated. Two weeks later, though, knowing now that the DOJ was willing to order a dragnet of AP reporters’ phone records and actually read James Rosen’s e-mails, there’s no way around the obvious suspicion. If the feds were willing to monitor Rosen and the AP in the name of cracking down on leakers, why wouldn’t they monitor the one reporter from non-Fox big media who’s done more digging on Fast and Furious and Benghazi than anyone else?
Attkisson told Laura Ingraham in October 2011 that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting. The DOJ wasn’t happy either:
I’m certainly not the one to make the case for DOJ and White House about what I’m doing wrong. They will tell you that I’m the only reporter–as they told me–that is not reasonable. They say the Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, the New York Times is reasonable, I’m the only one who thinks this is a story, and they think I’m unfair and biased by pursuing it.
Which government sources were aiding and abetting this “unreasonable” reporter? There was one obvious way to find out. Any comment, DOJ?
Here’s the clip. The full Stigall podcast can be found here . Obvious exit question: Whether Attkisson was monitored or not, it can’t be just the AP and Rosen whom the feds have snooped on in four years. How many other reporters?

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/21/1210824/-ObamaCare-Betrayal-Big-Corporations-To-Offer-Health-Insurance-NOT-Covering-Hospital-Stays-Surgery|128 Comments
If you work at Bill Miller Bar-B-Q in Texas, ObamaCare means that you'll get the following insurance plan. Oh, you lucky duckies! From the debacle that is putting preservation of private health insurance corporation profits ahead of public health:
San Antonio-based Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, a 4,200-worker chain, will replace its own mini-med with a new, skinny plan in July. The new plan... will cover only preventive services, six annual doctors' visits and generic drugs. X-rays and tests at a local urgent care chain will also be covered. It wouldn't cover surgeries or hospital stays.
You got that right -- thanks to immoral employers -- and gutless politicians and regulators -- big business will be able to offer the same 'shitty deals' to their employees that they have in the past without getting in any trouble:
Employers are increasingly recognizing they may be able to avoid certain penalties under the federal health law by offering very limited plans that can lack key benefits such as hospital coverage.
Benefits advisers and insurance brokers—bucking a commonly held expectation that the law would broadly enrich benefits—are pitching these low-benefit plans around the country. They cover minimal requirements such as preventive services, but often little more. Some of the plans wouldn't cover surgery, X-rays or prenatal care at all.
Federal officials say this type of plan, in concept, would appear to qualify as acceptable minimum coverage under the law, and let most employers avoid an across-the-workforce $2,000-per-worker penalty for firms that offer nothing.
The idea that such plans would be allowable under the law has emerged only recently. Some benefits advisers still feel they could face regulatory uncertainty. The law requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty. Many employers and benefits experts have understood the rules to require robust insurance, covering a list of "essential" benefits such as mental-health services and a high percentage of workers' overall costs.
Say what?! Employers are set to screw over employees by providing them with coverage that won't even help them pay the bill for a broken leg, and the Federal Government is agreeing with these bastards 'in concept'?
Fuck you, Max Baucus, and weak-kneed Health & Human Services bureaucrats:
But a close reading of the rules makes it clear that those mandates affect only plans sponsored by insurers that are sold to small businesses and individuals, federal officials confirm. That affects only about 30 million of the more than 160 million people with private insurance, including 19 million people covered by employers, according to a Citigroup Inc. C +0.20% report. Larger employers, generally with more than 50 workers, need cover only preventive services, without a lifetime or annual dollar-value limit, in order to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty.
Such policies would generally cost far less to provide than paying the penalty or providing more comprehensive benefits, say benefit-services firms.
Administration officials confirmed in interviews that the skinny plans, in concept, would be sufficient to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty. Several expressed surprise that employers would consider the approach.
Of course, our friends at Aetna and Cigna must be drooling over this travesty -- they make big bucks on junk insurance that covers nothing at all.
In short, from Physicians for a National Health Program :
Imagine health insurance not covering hospitalizations nor surgery. Yet this is still possible because the Affordable Care Act applies the essential health benefit requirement only to plans for small businesses and individuals and not to larger employers.
This has opened up the opportunity for a conspiracy between larger employers who could care less whether or not their employees have health insurance and private insurers who are quite willing to sell these almost worthless bare-bones products as long as there is a profitable market for them.
The solution is obvious. Cover all care that people need, and then provide that coverage to everyone, automatically. Maybe these uncaring employers might not like that, but when the taxes to pay for an equitable system are obligatory, they would get used to the idea of their employees being able to obtain health care when they need it. Not such a bad idea after all, especially when their competitors are treated the same.
Our health care non-system is fucking barbaric, cruel and insane.
SinglePayer (Medicare For All) is the only solution -- clearly, our private insurance and corporate overlords are unwilling to submit to the regulatory oversight necessary to make a 'market-based' Swiss system work in this country.

7 Things About The Mainstream Media That They Do Not Want You To Know
By Michael, on May 20th, 2013
Have you ever wondered who controls the mainstream media?  In America today, we are more "connected" than ever.  The average American watches 153 hours of television a month, and we also spend countless hours watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading books and surfing the Internet.  If someone could control the production of all of that media, that would make them immensely powerful.  They would literally be in a position to tell people what to think.  Well, what if I told you that there are just six enormous media conglomerates that combine to produce about 90 percent of all the media that Americans consume.  Would that alarm you?  It should alarm you.  The truth is that our attitudes, opinions and beliefs are greatly shaped by what we allow into our minds.  After all, they don't call it "programming" for no reason.  Even those of us that realize that we are connected to "the matrix" probably greatly underestimate the tremendous influence that the media has over us.  We live at a time when it is absolutely imperative to think for ourselves, but most Americans are being absolutely overwhelmed with information and seem more than content to let others do their thinking for them.  Sadly, this is greatly contributing to the downfall of our society.
And of course the mainstream media desperately does not want you to look at "the man behind the curtain".  They just want you to stay plugged into the "programming" that they are feeding you without asking any questions.
Fortunately, a growing minority of Americans are waking up and are starting to reject the mainstream media.  An increasing number of people are beginning to recognize that the mainstream media is the mouthpiece of the establishment and that it is promoting the agenda of the establishment.
So why is the mainstream media so bad?  The following are 7 things about the mainstream media that they do not want you to know...
#1 The Mainstream Media Has Very Deep Ties To The Establishment
Did you know that the president of CBS and the president of ABC both have brothers that are top officials in the Obama administration?
The big news networks have developed an almost incestuous relationship with the federal government in recent years.  But of course the same could be said of the relationship that the media has with the big corporations that own stock in their parent companies and that advertise on their networks.
This is one of the reasons why we very rarely ever see any hard hitting stories on the big networks anymore.  The flow of information through the corporate-dominated media is very tightly controlled, and there are a lot of gatekeepers that make sure that the "wrong stories" don't get put out to the public.  As a result, many of the "big stories" that have come out in recent years were originally broken by the alternative media.
#2 The Mainstream Media Gets Things Wrong Very Frequently
Even prominent members of the mainstream media admit that this is the case.  For example, during a recent speech at Quinnipiac University CBS anchor Scott Pelley confessed that journalists in the mainstream media " are getting big stories wrong, over and over again" ...
"Let me take the first arrow: During our coverage of Newtown, I sat on my set and I reported that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the school. And that her son had attacked her classroom. It's a hell of a story, but it was dead wrong. Now, I was the managing editor, I made the decision to go ahead with that and I did, and that's what I said, and I was absolutely wrong. So let me just take the first arrow here."
#3 The American Public Does Not Consider The Media To Be Very Trustworthy
Trust in the mainstream media has definitely been slipping.  In fact, a Gallup poll taken last year found that distrust of the media had reached an all-time high .  According to that poll, 60 percent of Americans "have little or no trust" that the media is reporting the news accurately.
A separate Rasmussen Reports survey found that only 6 percent of all Americans consider the news media to be "very trustworthy".
Hopefully this trend will accelerate and a lot more people will stop trusting the media blindly.
#4 The Mainstream Media And The Politicians That They Worship Hate The Fact That They Cannot Control Internet News Sites
In the old days, the mainstream media had a virtual monopoly on the news.  But these days, anyone with an Internet connection can put up a news site, and this is driving the establishment absolutely bonkers.
For example, Barack Obama is known to have a great dislike for the alternative media.  The following is from a recent  WND article ...
NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd says President Obama was making it “clear” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner over the weekend how he feels about the rise of Internet news sites like Politico, Buzzfeed and … well, WND.
“He hates it.”
Appearing on “Meet the Press” Sunday morning following Saturday night’s media, politics and celebrity soiree, Todd explained the president’s disdain for independent online news sources was showing during his speech.
“It did seem … I thought his pot shots, joke-wise, and then the serious stuff about the Internet, the rise of the Internet media and social media and all that stuff – he hates it, OK? He hates this part of the media,” Todd said. “He really thinks that the, sort of, the buzzification – this isn’t just about Buzzfeed or Politico and all this stuff – he thinks that sort of coverage of political media has hurt political discourse. He hates it. And I think he was just trying to make that clear last night.”
#5 The Mainstream Media Is Extremely Liberal
When it comes to politics, the mainstream media is far more liberal than the general population is.
For example, one survey found that  41 percent of American voters believe that the average reporter is more liberal than they are, while only 18 percent believe that the average reporter is more conservative than they are.
A very disturbing UCLA study on media bias discovered that the vast majority of media outlets are "left of center"...
Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS’ “Evening News,” The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal.
And even MSNBC has confirmed the liberal bias of the media.  According to MSNBC , mainstream journalists are far more likely to donate their own money to Democrats than they are to Republicans...
MSNBC.com identified 143 journalists who made political contributions from 2004 through the start of the 2008 campaign, according to the public records of the Federal Election Commission. Most of the newsroom checkbooks leaned to the left: 125 journalists gave to Democrats and liberal causes. Only 16 gave to Republicans. Two gave to both parties.
#6 Six Mammoth Media Corporations Produce About 90 Percent Of The Media That Americans Consume
As I mentioned at the top of this article, there are six giant media behemoths that control almost all of the media that we consume.  These corporate giants own television networks, cable channels, movie studios, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, video game makers, music labels and even many of our favorite websites.
The media ownership chart posted below originally comes from a previous article that I authored entitled " Who Owns The Media? The 6 Monolithic Corporations That Control Almost Everything We Watch, Hear And Read ", but it has been updated to reflect some of the latest information.  The power that these companies have is so vast that it is hard to put into words...

#7 The American People Are Absolutely Addicted To The Mainstream Media
In a previous article about the media , I noted that the average American watches 153 hours of television a month.
When you allow that much information to be downloaded into your brain, it is going to have a dramatic impact on how you think.
Americans are more "connected" than they ever have been before.  This is especially true of our kids.  They are constantly on one sort of electronic device or another.  The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Daniel Taylor ...
According to a 2010 LA Times report , young people spend on average 53 hours a week watching TV, playing video games, and sitting at the computer.
Facebook users spend about 15 hours a month on the social networking site.
People are walking – and driving – blindly while texting, sometimes walking into fountains and even falling off cliffs.
If that Los Angeles Times report is true, that means that our young people are spending more than 200 hours a month connected to the media.
But we are only awake for about 480 hours a month.
When it comes to influencing the American people, nobody has more power than the big media companies do.
And until we can break this sick addiction to the mainstream media and get people to start thinking for themselves, we will never see widespread changes in our society.  As long as people are being "programmed" by the mainstream media, they will continue to express the opinions, attitudes and beliefs that have been downloaded into their minds.
Please share this article with as many people as you can.  It is crucial that we wake as many people up as possible while we still can.
Be Sociable, Share!
There’s a reason it’s referred to as the Govt Media Complex.

I do not even watch the national news anymore. We call it MSM, mainstream media. We ought to call it MOP, ministry of propaganda. Whether you are talking about the news or the banks, or many other areas of society. Too few, control way too much. Michael, your book arrived just three days after I ordered it. Considering I chose standard shipping, excellent shipping time. Sorry no review, saving it for my vacation.

Turning it off is the best thing any of us can do to fight back.  When your friends and family start talking about this or that on TV, say “sorry, we don’t watch TV” and check out the look on their faces.  We’ve been a Zero TV Home since 1998 and love that look.  And we don’t miss TV one tiny bit.

MOP (Ministry of Propaganda)…
Good one.  Everybody here should use that line from now on instead of MSM.  See how long it takes CNN (etc) to pick up on it.

I away thought the news was pretty right wing. It seems to me that the really rich control the news not the liberals.

I don’t believe it is either “right” or “left”, as I talked to someone on the left who is truely unhappy with the media!  (Genuine left wing ideas, not what the media portrays as left.). It really truely is whatever is on the agenda of the “really wealthy”.  This whole “left” and “right” division is really just to divide people…

That’s exactly what they want you to think! “L v R.” How about there is no difference between the two parties? If there were, you’d actually see laws that one side passed being overturned by the other, yet that is NEVER the case. I’ve watched this for 60 years and it’s always the same. The only difference is that each election cycle new people take a side. Wake up folks! There’s only one side and you aren’t on it!

Those six media giants that control everything are themselves part of a world-wide, intertwined group of ultra-powerful corporations that are, in turn, controlled by a number of mega-corporations under the most powerful families on Earth.  They always were and they always will be.  I used to think that was the stuff of conspiracy nuts, but those ultra-powerful people don’t even try to keep it a secret anymore.

New Scientist Magazine released the data in Q2/2012 of who the 147 corporations are that control 85% of the worlds wealth.
The names of the board of directors running such corporations was even more enlightening.

I don’t think many people here are quite grasping what you mean by “super rich”.  Very few Hollywood type celebrities are even close to super wealthy, they have just enough to shut them up and keep them entertaining the peasants.
Come to think of it I don’t think they get what you mean by liberal either.  Bill Gates and George Soros?  Super wealthy, yes, liberal, well I think that’s debatable.  It’s one thing to talk the talk and throw a little money to charity as a token gesture, it’s quite another to actually accept a downgrade in one’s own lifestyle in order to allow others a chance in the game of life.  Names like Rockefeller are what we’re really looking at when we talk about super rich, and I don’t think they have ever been accused of being liberal.

That’s why none of these scandals will affect Obama, no matter how bad they get.  The mainstream media won’t go after him like they went after Nixon, in fact they will cover for him.

Agreed, but it’s how the govt media complex and the public school system have conditioned us over the last 40-50 years so Mission accomplished !
And now the govt wants to make sure it stays that way by buying up all the ammo, disarming American citizens while stockpiling their own inventory. We have said it here many times but even today Rush admitted we have become the Banana Republic of America.

Ironically, Rush Bimbo is and has been a part of the problem.  Just like Pawn Hannity and others, they supported/defended GWB’s TYRANNY and then they talk against Obama’s TYRANNY, when in fact it all goes hand in hand!  That is their job, the PROSTITUTES in the media, to keep you all confused with the 2 party…1 party system.  You all believe their is one ounce of difference in the 2 parties???  Yes…you say.  Ahhh, the production based programming for theater is working just as it was designed to…for you SHEEPLE!
El Pollo de Oro
Ricky Ross; Very insightful post. Rush “Pillhead” Limbaugh (the OxyContin king), Bill-O The Clown and other neocons are propagandists for the Repuli-Con wing of the War Party, while MSNBC (also known as ONN, the Obama News Network) are propagandists for the Democrap wing of the War Party. But the American sheeple, to a large degree, are gullible tribalists. So they could care less how much “our guy” rapes and pillages as long as it is “our guy.” Faux News and MSNBC serve different wings of the War Party, but both serve the War Party.
“Barack Obama is so dangerous because he makes people that are traditionally anti-torture, anti-war, anti-police state just say, ‘Hey, I want NDAA. I want troops on the street. I want TSA sticking their hands down our pants. I want banker bailouts because it’s Obama.’  And strong conservatives went to sleep under Bush because hey, he’s a Republican.”—Alex Jones
“All the two parties are fighting for is who gets to
be the whore, the prostitute for the interest groups.”—Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
“I will not vote for the lesser of two evils. I will not support this criminality any
longer. I will not vote for the Gambinos or the Bonannos. I will not vote for the Republicans or the Democrats. To me, it’s a two-bit freak show.”—Gerald Celente
Lennie Pike
I agree. There will be outrage from Fox News, “conservative” radio, and the Republican Party – all a kabooki show for people who do not think for themselves. Control the fiat money scam and “they” control everything and everyone – almost
but unfortunately for them, not quite enough.

These so-called scandals have yet to place any criminality in the hands of the White House, unlike Watergate.

I honestly believe that Obama could be found–concrete and irrefutable evidence–to have ordered guns given to Mexican drug cartels, or given weapons to Al Quaeda in Libya which were used to kill Americans and destroy our embassy, or even joked about his use of the IRS to bully his political opponents–there could be evidence that he had his hand directly in all of these things and he would still be untouched……
OH, WAIT!!!….He actually was complicit in all of these events and the public and media responds with a yawn.
He could probably get caught like Marion Barry of DC with a crack pipe and hooker on tape and would still have tens of millions fawning at his feet………
Obama (like Oprah) is a cult………

I agree. In another article I wrote about this. I blame the feminist movement. They took the most important role in society and vilified it. Then, they convinced the women that they MUST join the slave/work force to be considered successful. Pitiful, but it worked just like it was supposed to. And now look at us.
Graham
Feminism also substantially increased the tax revenue that the IRS could collect.  They referred to it as the other 50%.
In a planned double whammy (see Rockefeller history), it also led to the breakup of the traditional family unit where kids were simply passed to the “State” for education.  The parents got bizzy elsewhere.
Other things have been strongly promoted since and it is being pushed everywhere left, right and centre.  The aim is moral and societal destruction at every conceivable level.
I will refrain from naming the specific group who are responsible for such outrageous mayhem.  They create war as well.
They also electronically create money in a similar fashion to yanking a rabbit out of a hat then charging the public for the pet food to keep all the rabbits alive.
Those in their 40′s/50′s/60′s plus must be going through a daily mind warp trying to figure it all out.

Children are born with a clean slate, pure, with no ideological hang-ups to dampen their wonder of the world around them.  It’s the parents and society that teaches them to be bigoted, and they mimic their parents bigotry because they adore them and want to please them.  Personally I think having two loving parents, regardless of gender, is worth a lot more to a child than having one or two dysfunctional ones.  But, sigh, homophobia is a great distraction from the real issues at hand, and it works wonders to divide communities.

What stuns me the most is this: this week, Obama’s approval rating actually increased to 53%, despite the scandals going on. This just goes to show how apathetic most Americans have become. Even worse, this sends the message that Obama, and the Government as a whole, can pretty much do whatever they want at this point, since the public is unlikely to go after them. If this isn’t a bad sign, I don’t know what is.

assuming the 53% is real……..

Yep, about as real as the unemployment numbers.

Wait…let me guess…you got that 53% number from….THE MEDIA! Just goes to show you that no matter how much someone dislikes or distrusts the MSM…for some reason they STILL believe some of the true garbage they pump out…53%…I don’t think so…IT’S THE MEDIA PEOPLE!

I don’t know.  Each day I become more convinced that people are getting dumber and dumber so it’s plausible to me that 53% of our population are stupid enough to approve.

Brainiac was a UK TV series that prove how quickly thermite could melt through a car engine block.
Funny, all the post 9/11 tests I saw of the substance being ignited in America made one think it can’t “cut” through steel.

JAH666
Brainiac was also a continuing character in DC comic books in the 60′s and 70′s. He was a green skinned, super intelligent android that regularly crossed swords with Superman.  He had stolen an entire Kryptonian city before the planet was destroyed when it’s sun went nova, and kept it miniaturized in a bottle so that he could study the inhabitants.  Superman got wind of this and recovered Kandor after an epic battle with Bainiac.

You can forget making people “wake up”. America is the most TV saturated country on the planet. People can’t get enough of crap on TV. No one watches more TV in the world than Americans. I recommend the movie “Network” which predicted all of these things over 30 years ago.

The problem you speak of comes from a lack of cerebral coherence between the two hemispheres.  The vast majority of people are “left brain dominant”.
It is the “ego” which causes all the problems and when left unchecked, it becomes sociopathic, narcissistic and psychopathic in its nature.

yes, the mainstream media is our enemy. A wise person knows their enemy inside and out. Watching the national news is NOT a waste of time. I watch every night then go and find the truth by other means and measure the difference.
TX4Life
I love to compare and contrast the way the different news outlets portray situations.  They can certainly draw opposite conclusions among them.  They especially love to isolate one seemingly positive bit of economic news and try to convince the viewers that we’re in a real recovery. Never mind the other negative bits that continue to decline.
Graham
Yes… we are in a “recovery” and hopefully it will continue to blossom.
I refer to the many who appear to be rediscovering their own voice, sanity and consciousness (waking up).
Graham
Likewise.  I strongly believe all sides of the coin have to be observed in order to properly dissect and compartmentalise who is saying what and why.
As the MSM ratings continue to suffer, I note they refer often to the alternate media, usually trying to beat it down.  This will change after the recent “trilogy” of high profile “blunders”.
Even BritBoy Redcoat Pierce Morgan is changing his tune on the tyranny front.  Next week he will likely be pushing 3D printers or the new laser rifle.

The mainstream aka government controlled media is the tool by which we are heading like a speed train to secular totalitarianism and pervasive evil. The government and the media [except for Newscorp/Fox] is the means by which traditional America and our founding Judaio-Christian value system is evaporating. If the true facts of a story cannot be controlled, manipulated to fit the mainstream left wing secular outcome, it is ignored by all of the large media outlets. Remember how the lefty devils in the media ran with the phony rigged up Duke Lacrosse rape case until they could not push the lie any further ? There have been countless examples since 8+15+1969, where the mainstream liars contorted or ignored facts to fit their secular outcome.I used to sit and watch the evening news in the 70′s with my mother. I would ask her why the three networks would cover the same stories. She did not know then, but we all know now.  Recently, the murdering infanticide doctors Gosnell and the latest from Texas receive almost no coverage by the secular totalitarian left. Remember the liars on the left saying that legal abortion, aka murder, would prevent back alley abortions. MURDERING LIARS. Look at these death camps run by Planned Parenthood. The blaspemy by OB asking God to bless PP was outragious. Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Lifers assemble peacefully in Washington each year and this receives little to no coverage from the government controlled media. The crushing budget deficits and the national debt receives almost no coverage. Pres. Obama would not have been able to pass a security clearance for most government jobs and is our sitting President for two terms because the government controlled media decided to ignore his school records and much of his past. Mitt Romney, a good virtuous man, was run out of town by the demons on the left. The left wing media knows that Benghazi is 10 times worse than Watergate and will only give it slight coverage. The government controlled company line and outcome is that we will learn from it and we will move forward. The phony Watergate scandal was drilled into our heads for ten years. No Americans died because of Watergate but we fed four Americans to the wolves in Benghazi. American lives are wothless to these globalist totalitarians. Meanwhile, we have wire tapping and spying going on 24/7. When will America wake up ? When will America sober up and realize that this secularsocial experiment which metastasised on 8+15+1969 is a world wrecking failure. Shame on you Judas Catholics for what your have done.

Back in the day when the MSM was not a parrot to the shadow gubermint, one would hear news stories from different MSM outlets and they would never be identical like today. You could tell each news outlet was doing their own work and seeing things differently. Not today….and technology has nothing to do with it. It’s no secret the shadow gubermint is in bed with the media…more like the media’s masters and overseers. Always remember the 3 tools these miscreants have at their  disposal: Intimidation…Manipulation…Provocation. 99% of the time you can attribute at least 1 of these tools to their dirty deeds…it’s their finger print.

The inability of the elites to control anything led them to push mainstream media on the forefront with the false hope that by manipulating peoples perceptions and beliefs would convince everybody that they are in control when in reality they cannot drive their own car.
They really think that people can be totally programmed to believe that some super wealthy elite is pulling all the strings on this planet and everybody else should bow down to them.
Very funny. Our elites are becoming our clowns!

You're right on top of it. Petraeus was a four star general and the director of the CIA. I find it hard to believe there was something happening like this and he was totally out of the loop.
As the CIA director he probably had to accept the loss of life as the leader of the Agency. As a military man, it appears he abandoned the two brave seals. If he did know something and testified to it it would show that he still had military character. If he didn't know anything he was probably padding his pension as the CIA director. But as four star generals go, he might as well have got the stars as prizes from Cracker Jack

Ham and Petraeus: lions in the field and lambs in the hall, in an odd twist. I know I'm brave to volunteer them for risking their freedom by sharing classified info, but hell, I can't do it myself. I only know as much as Hillary and Obama.

Faceless, appreciate your view, however; a lion is a lion whether in the jungle or a zoo. Is Petraeus simply an administrative lion/political general in the end?

(And then remove the Commanders that wanted to rush in help!)  Plus deliberately sending that Ambassador into that specific place and time and then the attack starts within one hour of time of his scheduled meeting.  Explain that behavior.  The best explanations I've seen is that the intent was to set up a kidnapping of the Ambassador for an exchange for the Egyptian Cleric we hold in jail (AND that Obama had tried earlier to send back to Egypt but Congress intervened).  The motive could have been to make Obama look strong in foreign relations just before the election.  I have no idea if that was true, but the explanations that the administration has provided DO NOT support what happened.
Only the explanation that the attack was expected and supported for "some" purpose provides the motive for the repeated denied extra security and repeated "Stand Down" orders given to do those that wanted and COULD HAVE provided aid.
Other explanations center around the likelihood of secret arms shipments being passed through Libya orchestrated by Ambassador Stevens.  But I don't think it explains the clear effort to deny security and aid.  Somebody wanted the bad guys at the gate to be successful in their intrusion.  My guess it wasn't supposed to kill anyone but the four Seals that returned to help (although having been told NOT to) provided a means to fight back and things soon got out of control.  Then the administration was in need of do some very fast track covering to avoid discovery.  The FBI wasn't even on site to do any investigating until a MONTH later.  And all the injured where kept away from the press.  And Hillary suddenly banged her head and avoided Congress.  Delay, delay.  Nothing to see here, move on.  And now,  of course, we hear from Hillary, "What Difference Does It Make??".  Clearly they hope that the answer is now that it doesn't..
Just the normal bumbling of the administration does not explain why they took such coordinated efforts to avoid providing aid.  There was NO real risk to the politicians in sending aid.  In fact, it was the LOW risk decision even if it was too late.   But it was actively denied.  Politicians would want to be seen as acting to help UNLESS something else more important to them was intended.
Note, that the whole IRS mess was deliberately released by the Gov itself!!  Just imagine that.  WHY would the IRS be told to tell a reporter to ask a specific question at a press conference just to be able to reveal what they've been up to.  We would not even have knowledge of what the IRS had been doing without having the culprits themselves revealing it!!!  (Plus it is a scandal that Obama is personally well isolated from while the Benghazi affair he ISN'T.)  Remember the best way to refocus an investigation is to start a bigger or more visible or more accessible fire somewhere else.
I'm not a conspiracy nut, but clearly this administration is fully capable of using false flags and false rescues if it served their political purposes.  These guys have NO moral compasses.  (Most politicians are capable of such.)
I suspect that if the truth does come out, Obama could be impeached.  But he has incredible powers to keep things suppressed, dodge the blame and pin the responsibility elsewhere.  I'm not overly confident that we'll know the truth while he is in office.  Maybe never.  But keeping such big secrets is very difficult especially after the culprit is no longer President and no longer has suppressive powers.
Don’t let up.  Keep digging.  Clearly there is something VERY, VERY, VALUABLE buried there.  They’ll take almost any scandal hit rather than let Benghazi be fully discovered.

More than a few people think it was a hit, that Stevens had to go. Whatever the true story, it is lethal, and it is why the other scandals emerged at the same time. They do not want this uncovered.

I've always thought the video was a loose end (among all the others). If they already knew it was a crock, how come it surfaced so conveniently? And how come the producer Noukala is still in prison? Something else stinks from that angle.

http://original.antiwar.com/vlahos/2013/05/21/antiwar-com-sues-fbi-after-secret-surveillance/|Share This
WASHINGTON – Antiwar.com is taking the FBI to court.
The website’s founder and managing editor Eric Garris, along with longtime editorial director Justin Raimondo, filed a lawsuit in federal court today, demanding the release of records they believe the FBI is keeping on them and the 17-year-old online magazine.
Antiwar.com says this is one more example of post-9/11 government overreach, and a stark reminder that the First Amendment has been treated as little more than a speed bump on the road to a government surveillance state. The lawsuit is particularly timely, considering recent scandals in which the Department of Justice secretly seized months of journalists’ phone records at the Associated Press, and did the same and more to a FOX News reporter , while the IRS is acknowledging it singled out conservative groups that criticize the government for extra scrutiny.
Suddenly, the press is more aware than ever that the state has the ability to secretly monitor its activities, heretofore thought of as constitutionally protected from government interference and intimidation.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy, whether it’s AP or Antiwar.com,” said Julia Harumi Mass, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which is representing Antiwar.com in the case. “FBI surveillance of news organizations interferes with journalists’ ability to do their jobs as watchdogs that hold the government accountable.”
The suit was filed on Tuesday at the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. Both Garris and Raimondo live and work in the San Francisco Bay area.
According to the suit, the ACLU has made several futile attempts to obtain the FBI files since a reader alerted Garris and Raimondo to this lengthy FBI memo in 2011. The details in question begin at page 62 of the heavily redacted 94-page document. It’s clear from these documents, the suit alleges, that the FBI has files on Garris and Raimondo, and at one point the FBI agent writing the April 30, 2004 memo on Antiwar.com recommends further monitoring of the website in the form of opening a “preliminary investigation …to determine if [redaction] are engaging in, or have engaged in, activities which constitute a threat to national security.”
“On one hand it seemed almost funny that we would be considered a threat to national security, but it’s very scary, because what we are engaging in is free speech, and free speech by ordinary citizens and journalists is now being considered a threat to national security and they don’t have to prove it because the government has the ability to suppress information and not disclose any of their activities – as witnessed with what is going on now at the AP and other things,” said Garris.
“The government’s attitude is they want to know all, but they want the public to know as little as possible.”
In response, the ACLU began filing requests in December 2011 under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for any records the FBI was currently holding on Antiwar.com, which describes itself as a Libertarian-inspired project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. It was clear from reading the memo that Antiwar.com came under the radar in part for its mission, which is characterized as publishing a non-interventionist “online magazine and research tool designed to keep the American people and the world informed about the overseas plans of the American government.” [Full disclosure, this writer is a regular contributor].
While openly acknowledging that we have an agenda, the editors take seriously our purely journalistic mission, which is to get past the media filters and reveal the truth about America’s foreign policy. Citing a wide variety of sources without fear or favor, and presenting our own views in the regular columns of various contributors, we clearly differentiate between fact and opinion, and let our readers know which is which.
The website was also targeted, according to the FBI memo, for links it published to counter-terrorism watch lists (which were already in the public domain), and for the people who were visiting Antiwar.com and/or talking it up at rallies. The FBI noted at least two of Raimondo’s columns and wondered openly, “who are (Antiwar.com’s) contributors and what are the funds utilized for?” This, after acknowledging there was no evidence of any crime being plotted or committed.
“This illustrates the troubling, continuing efforts of the federal government to monitor protected speech activity without evidence or even allegation of criminal activity,” said Mass, who explained that there are specific prohibitions against such surveillance and record-keeping in the 1974 Privacy Act [5 U.S.C 552a(e)(7)] .
After Raimondo wrote about the FBI memo in August 2011 , which at the time, independent journalist Marcy Wheeler at EmptyWheel.net deemed a “troubling story,” Antiwar.com started losing donors, and according to the lawsuit, it was big time.
In October 2011, one of Antiwar.com’s major donors withdrew his financial support from Antiwar.com out of concern that the FBI would monitor him if he continued to provide, as he wished to do, financial support to Antiwar.com. Since then, three significant donors have also withdrawn financial support, citing their fear that FBI interest in Antiwar.com would lead to surveillance of the donors as a reason for withdrawing financial support. As a result, Antiwar.com has lost about $75,000 per year since 2011 in otherwise expected contributions.
Reached over the weekend, Wheeler, who routinely investigates and reports on the impact of post-9/11 government surveillance on civil liberties for EmptyWheel.net , voiced her concern about the apparent FBI surveillance of Antiwar.com and its far-reaching implications.
“It’s likely (the) FBI is hiding one or another things: Bush era investigations into the peace community that were improper to start with, and/or the degree to which First Amendment activities have become one reason to investigate completely innocent activity,” she said.
After a series of FOIA requests, amended requests and empty responses, Garris and Raimondo have “received no agency determination setting forth whether Defendant FBI intends to produce records or any basis for withholding them,” since the last request dated May 24, 2012. Taking it to court, Mass said, is the next step.
“Our clients are entitled to obtain records the FBI has gathered about them and their online magazine,” she said. “This is especially important because the FBI’s surveillance has impacted our clients’ ability to maintain support for their website and has impacted their editorial choices– exactly the type of harm the First Amendment is supposed to protect against.”
How it went down
The strange and unsettling story of Antiwar.com’s debut into the domestic War on Terror came in the summer of 2011, when a reader warned Garris and Raimondo that the website had been mentioned as a target of surveillance by the FBI in the batch of documents the reader said he obtained through a FOIA request and had subsequently posted on his blog.
The documents mostly concern a 2001 investigation of five Israeli nationals who were witnessed smiling and celebrating and taking pictures of the burning Twin Towers from a rooftop perch across the river from Manhattan in Union City, New Jersey, on 9/11. After witnesses called the police, the individuals, who all worked for a local moving company, were taken into custody and grilled by FBI and CIA for two months after it was deemed their work visas had expired, and there was a big wad of cash, box cutters and other items that raised red flags found in a search of their work van. Questions revolved around whether the Israelis were spies connected to the Israeli government, and whether they had foreknowledge of the tragic events.
The heavily redacted memo says the men were eventually deported back to Israel without charge, and the case closed. However, the FBI still had an interest in tracking evidence gleaned from the case and this is where Antiwar.com comes into the picture. Raimondo, in writing about the case of the five Israelis in 2002 , linked to an American-generated terror watchlist (which had been published elsewhere on the Internet) that went out to Italian financial institutions and it included the name of the man who owned the New Jersey moving company in question.
It is not clear whether this sparked further monitoring of Antiwar.com, or whether Antiwar.com was already in the FBI’s sights. Interestingly, the memo states that the information attached to the memo as supporting material (none of which was available, aside from copies of two of Raimondo’s articles), was obtained in part through a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) request.
The FBI said it also searched the Web, as well as Lexis-Nexis, the Universal Index (FBI central records), the agency’s Electronic Case File, Department of Motor Vehicles and Dunn & Bradsheet (credit reports) for information on Antiwar.com and for “one or more individuals” working for the website.
Some of the things that can be discerned from those searches and were noted in the FBI memo:
– That Raimondo had been writing about the five Israelis and in his columns linked to at least three different terror watch lists (all found in the public domain).
–That Antiwar.com was cited in an article, the name of the author redacted, about U.S aid to Israel.
– That an article that listed Antiwar.com as a reference was handed out in 2002 at a “peaceful protest” at a British air base in the U.K.
– That a member of a domestic neo-Nazi group had “discussed a website, Antiwar.com” while encouraging fellow members at a conference to “educate themselves” about the Middle East conflict.
– That a special agent’s review of hard drives seized during an investigation of an unnamed subject, revealed that the subject had visited Antiwar.com between July 25, 2002 and June 15, 2003, “among many other websites.”
“There are several unanswered questions regarding www.antiwar.com,” reads the FBI memo. “It describes itself as a non-profit group that survives on generous contributions from its readers. Who are these contributors and what are the funds used for?”
The memo goes on to say that “many individuals worldwide do view this website including individuals who are currently under investigation and [two lines redacted].”
The unidentified agent writing the memo concludes, “it is recommended that ECAU (Electronic Communications Analysis Unit) further monitor the postings on the website … it is recommended that a PI (preliminary investigation) is opened to determine if [line redacted] have engaged in, or are engaging in, activities which constitute a threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power.”
This is the decisive point of the memo as it pertains to Antiwar.com: that Garris and Raimondo and Antiwar.com, for writing about a particularly sensitive subject and for linking to information that is already circulating around the Internet, may be a “threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power,” and therefore subject to secret surveillance. That would make any journalist, who say, linked a story to documents published by Wikileaks, which is currently under federal investigation , suspect too, surmised the plaintiffs.
“This sort of government activity is so chilling because it puts the fear of government at a higher level, and among the news media,” said Garris, noting the negative effect that federal leak investigations are already having on the free press. “Once the people aren’t able to get information, the government can, potentially, have unlimited power.”
According to Mass, the ACLU is filing a separate, administrative request to the FBI to find and further expunge any files it may have on Garris and Raimondo.
“The government,” concluded Mass, “cannot keep records about people’s exercise of free speech unless it is related to a criminal investigation.”
Update: Antiwar.com contacted the FBI for a statement for this story. A press official there declined, saying the agency could not comment on pending litigation.

Power and force are the name of the game.

The Obama administration has gotten itself into a fix between its contradictory stories about the Benghazi incident, reports of the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Justice Department’s grabbing of phone records from AP reporters. There are few things more fun to watch than arrogant political leaders -- folks who spend their lives bossing everyone around -- getting a comeuppance.
RELATED ARTICLES
Regulation
My favorite take wasn’t from any serious commentator but from comedian Jon Stewart, who noticed that the president routinely claims ignorance about embarrassing events by saying that he learned of them while watching the news: “I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announcing it on television.”
I take a bipartisan approach to Washington, DC’s political scandals and find myself savoring them all, regardless of the party that is in control of the White House. Any sane person would conclude that all administrations and bureaucracies essentially are corrupt given that they thrive on the exertion of power of other people. We know about the corrupting influence of power, and DC has become like ancient Rome that way. It’s a magnet for those seeking favor, money, or a big title administering some pointless program.
I visited DC last week and was astounded at the booming economy, the endless new construction, the astronomical prices, and garish displays of wealth everywhere -- not to mention the haughty attitudes of every pissant assistant to the whatever. That’s what Other People’s Money buys you. When Ronald Reagan talked about the Shining City on the Hill he was speaking metaphorically about America, but the new shining city is DC -- funded on the backs of all those Americans who blithely vote for people who promise to solve their problems.
That’s the main lesson from this latest mess: the federal government is an untamable beast. These superficial scandals are nothing compared to the things we will never learn -- i.e., the way the CIA conducts its business overseas.
Still, there are so many things to savor as President Obama circles the drain. Obama has always exuded an intellectual arrogance. Yet if he’s so smart, why would his Justice Department target reporters? The national media has fawned over the president, but the quickest way to end that love affair is to go after their personal records.
Unfortunately, many people insist on seeing every scandal in terms of partisanship. Conservatives are aghast, as they should be, at the thought of an IRS auditing groups based on their political views. That is eerily totalitarian. But where would they have been had a Republican administration done the same thing to liberal critics? I doubt the activist groups would be sending out the alarmist direct-mail pieces if the latest Bush were still president.
The best news from the ongoing drama is that people on the left and right see problems here. Let’s use that as a foundation for a renewed civil-liberties coalition that understands that there are many bright red lines in which the government -- regardless of who nominally is at the head of it -- does not cross. That’s easier to do when one realizes that our supposedly limited government is so limitless in its size, power, and taxing ability that no president can control it.
When pundits complain about excess partisanship, what they usually are really saying is they are tired of all the political fighting. Yet political fighting is good -- it’s a sign of differences of opinion and assures that important issues get debated, however clumsily, in the public.
In Sacramento, California, the Republican Party has imploded and there is little worry about partisanship. But the state’s Democratic Party is now engaged in policies so secretive that even liberal-oriented pundits are getting concerned. No one has the power to say no, so the Democrats are ramming through every manner of dangerous bill.
The new health-exchange law shields most contracts under a veil of secrecy so that public money can be dispensed to friends and cronies without the public learning about where it is going. Democratic leaders have embraced a gut-and-amend frenzy -- proposing dozens of bills with placeholder language that will be stripped away at the last minute with new and completely different language inserted. This circumvents normal debate and oversight.
This is not a Democratic problem per se, but a government problem. And local governments are arguably even more dangerous to our liberties. In Bakersfield recently, after Kern County sheriff’s deputies beat to death a young father (after being called to the scene for a minor incident -- public drunkenness), they grabbed the cellphones of bystanders who were recording the incident. That’s right out of a police state.
Government is about power and force. Many people charged with power over others will abuse it. That’s human nature. Unfortunately, the nation’s founding ideals -- limited, accountable government, with separated powers and checks and balances -- have been fading away. Government is so big that even the president and the attorney general claim they have no idea what their departments are doing. I almost believe them.
We need to rebuild a coalition of civil libertarians of the left and right who agree to some basics, on some bright red lines that no government should cross. We need to provide a unified, bipartisan front on behalf of individual liberties and against any official from any party who would trample them. Maybe we can learn that constructive lesson from the administration’s unreconstructed behavior.

Tom Coburn, James Inhofe(Credit: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/AP/Sue Ogrocki)
Just a week ago, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe suggested that President Obama might be impeached over the Benghazi non-scandal. Now, Inhofe must watch as Obama declares Inhofe’s state a disaster area and promises Oklahomans “all the resources they need at their disposal.”
Inhofe, of course, believes his state deserves those resources, even though he voted down aid to Hurricane Sandy victims. On MSNBC, Chris Jansing confronted Inhofe about his calling the Sandy aid bill a “slush fund,” and the brazen right-winger insisted the two issues shouldn’t be linked.
“Let’s look at that, that was totally different,” Inhofe told Jansing. “They were getting things — for instance that was supposed to be in New Jersey, they had things in the Virgin Islands, they were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C.; everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma.”
Inhofe’s answer is too dishonest to fully parse. First of all, there was Sandy damage way beyond New Jersey, including in the Caribbean and in Washington, D.C., too. And Inhofe had different objections to the Sandy bill at the time. In a rambling, hard-to-follow Senate floor speech blocking Sandy aid last December, the Oklahoma conservative objected to the bill’s timing — “There’s always a lot of theater right before Christmas time … We shouldn’t be talking about it right before Christmas” — even though it was already going on two months since the storm ravaged the East Coast.
Inhofe was also exercised by the fact that the Sandy bill included what he said was $28 billion for future disasters. But the climate-change denier was particularly outraged that the bill included $3.5 billion to deal with what he called “global warming,” which led to a long rant against cap-and-trade legislation, and then his floor speech unraveled. (Interestingly, Inhofe’s own press operation put the incoherent speech up on YouTube , as though it was a proud moment for the senator.)
Oklahoma’s other GOP senator, Tom Coburn, brags that he’s going to seek tornado relief — but insist that the funding is “offset” by other cuts to the federal budget. Coburn is proud that he’s being consistent by placing the same conditions on disaster aid to his own state as he’s demanded elsewhere. Consistent, maybe — but also fundamentally cruel.
Especially in the wake of the sequester cuts, the notion that the federal budget is larded with easily eliminated spending is ludicrous. Would Coburn like to see more kids thrown out of Head Start? More seniors losing Meals on Wheels? The federal deficit is shrinking faster than at any time since just after World War II, but Coburn is going to insist that someone, somewhere, must lose their federal help so Oklahoma can get it instead.
There’s something so typical about today’s GOP in the way Inhofe can dismiss comparisons between tornado aid and Sandy aid while Coburn grandstands for his long-term demand that new spending, even on disaster relief, must be “offset” by cuts elsewhere. Meanwhile, the notion that a new disaster relief bill should include funding to cope with future disasters isn’t lauded as common sense, it’s derided as pork. Like Inhofe, Coburn objected to the Sandy bill’s including funding for future disaster relief. (It should be noted that Moore, Okla., Rep. Tom Cole, also a Republican, voted for the Sandy aid bill.)
Just as modern conservatism helped create categories of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor, we now apparently have deserving and undeserving disasters. When tragedy strikes, most Americans tend to want to pull together, but many Republicans look to pull us apart, placing their own constituents’ needs above everyone else’s.

E.W. Jackson, the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor, began his career as a minister and attorney in Boston. While there, he lent his support to a high-profile 1988 fight against a plan to desegregate public housing developments in the neighborhood of South Boston.
The 1988 battle over housing desegregation in South Boston began after the federal government found the city of Boston had illegally segregated public housing and prevented African Americans from moving into public developments in the neighborhood. Boston was ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to come up with a new tenant selection plan or face a federal takeover of its public housing system. As a result, Ray Flynn, the city’s mayor, came up with a desegregation plan.
Local news station WGBH filmed Jackson giving a speech at a July 1988 community meeting in South Boston hosted by opponents of the mayor’s desegregation plan. According to WGBH, at the event Jackson dismissed the desegregation plan as “social engineering.” In his remarks, Jackson characterized the matter as a question of freedom of choice.
“I am so tired of hearing the people of South Boston dumped on by the saviors of mankind that it makes me nauseous,” Jackson said of desegregation advocates. “I can understand the reaction of the people of South Boston apart from the racial issue because I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either.”
Jackson, who was identified as a radio station manager and pastor of the New Corner Baptist Church in Roxbury, also spoke with a reporter from WGBH. In the interview, he indicated he believed people should be allowed to choose to live separately from members of other races.
“I think that maximum emphasis needs to be put on the ability of people to choose, even if that means some housing developments are predominantly of one race or another,” said Jackson.
The reporter who interviewed him also asked Jackson, who is African-American, if he felt as though he was being “used” by white politicians who opposed the desegregation plan. His response made it clear he fully supported their efforts.
“Well, the scripture says it’s a good thing to be used in a good cause,” Jackson said.
According to the biography on his campaign website , Jackson first moved to Boston with his wife, Theodora, in 1971 as part of his service in the U.S. Marine Corps. He and his wife left the city in 1998, a decision that was partly motivated, by “their desire for an environment more compatible with their conservative and Christian values.”
Since he was nominated to run in the gubernatorial race alongside Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli over the weekend, Jackson has drawn widespread attention for his past comments criticizing gays . He accused President Barack Obama of harboring “Muslim sensibilities.” and A video he once filmed compared Planned Parenthood to the KKK.
Jackson and the Cuccinelli campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

By William Peacock, Esq. on March 20, 2013 11:50 AM
"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich." Sounds like two Guinnesses and something made out of chicken, doesn't it? It's making us hungry.
It's not food and drink, however. It's a complicated corporate tax loophole, exploited by tech companies and others with intellectual property, pioneered by Apple, and used by many to save billions of dollars in taxes.
It all begins with the licensing of patents and IP to an Irish subsidiary. When products are sold in the U.S., taxes are reduced by paying royalties to that subsidiary. Under Irish law, if the subsidiary is managed by foreigners, profits skip along, Irish tax-free, usually to a Caribbean tax haven.
When products are sold outside of the U.S., profits are directed to another Irish subsidiary, who forwards the profits to the Netherlands under a tax-free treaty, which kicks the profits back to the initial Irish subsidiary, which exploits the same foreign-manager tax loophole to send money to the Caribbean.
Confused yet? Here's a pretty diagram , courtesy of the New York Times.
(Apple's innovations go far beyond the iPhone, don't they?)
Your first question: Is this all legal? It better be, as a number of tech companies are doing it, including Amazon and Google , reports CNBC.
Then again, not all of them are succeeding. The problem comes down to the value of that intellectual property, or " transfer pricing ." How much is a patent worth? When a company is licensing patents to itself, it's going to be tempted to set the value to the amount that will best benefit itself tax-wise. (Higher valuation means larger business expense deduction.)
Instead, companies are supposed to determine prices at "arm's length", meaning whatever price would be appropriate if they weren't licensing to themselves.
Inappropriate transfer pricing does come back to haunt some companies. In December, the Internal Revenue Service went after Amazon for $234 million in back taxes , claiming over-valuation of IP. Of course, the IRS is not always successful. They famously lost a similar case against Veritas Software (now part of Symantec) in 2010.
With all of that said, should you advise your company to take the same route? The savings don't lie: One study estimates that Apple saved between $2.4 and $4.8 billion in taxes . Just be sure that your transfer pricing is reasonable. (And if you aren't a tax lawyer, it's time to consult outside counsel.)

The landmark legislation easily passed the Judiciary Committee, giving reform its best chance in six years on the Senate floor. Yet even if the bill clears the Senate, the GOP-controlled House isn’t likely to take it up in its current form.
( PHOTOS: At a glance: The Senate immigration deal )
The vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments. But the Gang of Eight, which drafted the legislation, held together and fended off all but minor changes to the bill.
“This is a big step forward,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Gang. “We got a good vote in committee, we expanded our little group to another vote, and the feeling is very strong here. I think we gained some momentum today. I really do.”
Schumer and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters that they remained hopeful that the bill could pick up 70 votes on the Senate floor.
“I think it’s possible,” said Flake, another Gang member. “We got a lot of hard work to do. A lot of hard work.”
The committee room, which was packed with reform proponents, erupted in applause and cheers of “Yes, we can” after the final vote. Democratic senators posed for pictures with supporters and received a succession of high fives and hugs.
President Barack Obama issued a statement congratulating the committee and urging the Senate to take up the bill “at the earliest possible opportunity.”
( Also on POLITICO: House immigration talks hang on health care )
“The process for considering this legislation has been open and inclusive with multiple hearings, and more than a hundred amendments were considered and adopted, in many cases with bipartisan support,” Obama said. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I , but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”
Senate leaders hope to begin considering the bill following the Memorial Day recess in June. That prospect got a boost on Tuesday when Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would not block debate from starting on the floor.
House leaders want their members to put forward their own version of immigration reform, which will be more conservative than the Senate bill. A bipartisan group of House negotiators announced an agreement last week on reform principles, but the lawmakers are struggling to finalize the deal.

http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-predictable-failure-of-fiscal-austerity-by-robert-skidelsky|Austere Illusions
LONDON – The doctrine of imposing present pain for future benefit has a long history – stretching all the way back to Adam Smith and his praise of “parsimony.” It is particularly vociferous in “hard times.” In 1930, US President Herbert Hoover was advised by his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system...People will...live a more moral life...and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.”
To “liquidationists” of Mellon’s ilk, the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking, in housing, in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored. Their position is clear: the state is a parasite, sucking the lifeblood of free enterprise. Economies gravitate naturally to a full-employment equilibrium, and, after a shock, do so fairly quickly if not impeded by misguided government action. This is why they are fierce opponents of Keynesian interventionism.
Keynes’s heresy was to deny that there are any such natural forces, at least in the short term. This was the point of his famous remark, “In the long run we are all dead.” Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time. To believe otherwise is to commit the “fallacy of composition.” What is true of the parts is not true of the whole. If all of Europe is cutting, the United Kingdom cannot grow; if the entire world is cutting, global growth will stop.
In these circumstances, austerity is exactly the opposite of what is needed. A government cannot liquidate its deficit if the source of its revenues, the national income, is diminishing. It is deficit reduction, not debt, that is profligate, because it implies wastage of available human and physical capital, quite apart from the resulting misery.
Austerity’s advocates rely on one – and only one – argument: If fiscal contraction is part of a credible “consolidation” program aimed at permanently reducing the share of government in GDP, business expectations will be so encouraged by the prospect of lower taxes and higher profits that the resulting economic expansion will more than offset the contraction in demand caused by cuts in public spending. The economist Paul Krugman calls this the “confidence fairy.”
The pro-austerity argument is pure assertion, but it is meant to be a testable assertion, so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends, the faster the economy will grow. Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
Economists arrived at some striking correlations. For example , “an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a 0.5-1% lower annual growth rate.” In April 2010, the leader of this school, Harvard University’s Alberto Alesina, assured European finance ministers that “even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run.”
But two fallacies vitiated the “proofs” offered by Alesina and others. First, because the cuts had to be “credible” – that is, large and decisive – the continuing absence of growth could be blamed on the insufficiency of the cuts. Thus, Europe’s failure to recover “immediately” has been due to a lack of austerity, even though public-sector retrenchment has been unprecedented.
Second, the researchers committed the arch-statistical mistake of confusing correlation with causation. If you find a correlation between deficit reduction and growth, the reduction could be causing the growth or vice versa. (Or both the deficit reduction and the growth could be due to something else – devaluation or higher exports, for example.)
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end. Going through the same material as Alesina had, its authors pointed out that “while it is plausible to conjecture that confidence effects have been at play in our sample of consolidations, during downturns they do not seem to have ever been strong enough to make the consolidations expansionary.” Fiscal contraction is contractionary, period.
An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%. This finding reflected the massive overweighting of one country in their sample, and there was the same confusion between correlation and causation seen in Alesina’s work: high debt levels may cause a lack of growth, or a lack of growth may cause high debt levels.
On this foundation of zombie economics and slipshod research rests the case for austerity. In fact, the austerity boosters in the UK and Europe frequently cited the Alesina and Reinhart/Rogoff findings.
The results of austerity have been what any Keynesian would have expected: hardly any growth in the UK and the eurozone in the last two and a half years, and huge declines in some countries; little reduction in public deficits, despite large spending cuts; and higher national debts.
Two other consequences of austerity are less appreciated. First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed. Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
So we will remain in a state of “under-employment equilibrium” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed (and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse). In the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely, statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice.

Security Trumps Justice in Upcoming Manning Trial
As the pretrial concludes, 'Aiding the Enemy' charge stands while prosecutors drop 'Reykjavik-13'
- Lauren McCauley, staff writer
Tuesday marked the final day in pretrial hearings in the court martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning. (Credit: Reuters)Prosecutors will proceed with the charge that Pfc. Bradley Manning "aided the enemy" when the trial of the alleged whistleblower commences next week.
Tuesday marked the final day of pretrial hearings in the court martial of Manning during which attorneys for both sides and Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over the trial, issued a series of revisions for the upcoming trial.
During the hearing, Manning accepted as a "stipulation of fact" that the government has evidence that Osama Bin Laden had taken a "close personal interest" in the WikiLeaks materials. This "fact" was illustrated through a series of letters between Bin Laden and a member of al-Qaida—one of which included the Afghanistan "war logs" that were among the WikiLeaks disclosures.
Further, Lind issued a ruling Tuesday that the prosecution could use classified documents "within limits" to attempt to prove that the material Manning transmitted to WikiLeaks was potentially damaging to US interests.
The issue on how best to handle classified information throughout the trial has spurred some debate and prompted a " dry run " session after which Lind concluded it was "not possible to elicit coherently nuanced" testimony on classified information in open court and thus decided to close portions of the trial, independent blogger Kevin Gosztola reports.
"The over-riding interest in protecting national security over-rides the risk of miscarriage of justice," said Lind, who also added that it over-rode Manning's First Amendment rights.
Most notably, during Tuesday's proceedings military lawyers announced they were dropping one of the charges against him and would no longer seek to prove the US soldier was guilty of leaking the state department cable, known as "Reykjavik-13," which reportedly demonstrates the US's "bullying tactics against Iceland to accept austerity measures in the wake of the global financial meltdown."
The Guardian's Ed Pilkington reports:
[Manning] has pleaded guilty to a lesser offence relating to the leak of Reykjavik-13 and liable to a maximum of two years. The US government had sought to press further statutory charges on him that would have added up to an additional eight years on his sentence, but has now dropped the count.
However, the change may be "limited in significance," Pilkington adds, in light of the more serious accusation of "aiding the enemy." If Manning is found guilty of "assisting Osama bin Laden by making public information that could injure the US," he faces a potential life sentence with no chance of parole.
Pilkington continues: 
Should Manning be found not guilty to having aided the enemy, he still faces a further 20 counts carrying an overall maximum sentence of more than 150 years. At a minimum, the soldier has already pleaded guilty to lesser charges, of prejudicing the good order and discipline of the military by leaking information, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
The trial, which begins on June 3, will be the most high-profile prosecution by the Obama administration of a leak of state secrets. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has authorized more prosecutions of whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined.

Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports .
Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. "She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course," the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times .
Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would "have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."
The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question .
Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.
Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name "tea party" or "patriot."
According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration , Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.
Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave "false or misleading information" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.
"The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions," Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. "Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing -- the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs."

http://truth-out.org/news/item/16494-pbs-killed-wisconsin-uprising-documentary-citizen-koch-to-appease-koch-brothers|PBS Killed Wisconsin Uprising Documentary "Citizen Koch" To Appease Koch Brothers
Tuesday, 21 May 2013 09:19 By Brendan Fischer , PRWatch | Report
Email
(Photo: Elsewhere Films)"Citizen Koch," a documentary about money in politics focused on the Wisconsin uprising, was shunned by PBS for fear of offending billionaire industrialist David Koch, who has given $23 million to public television, according to  Jane Mayer of the  New Yorker . The dispute highlights the increasing role of private money in "public" television and raises even further concerns about the Kochs potentially purchasing eight major daily newspapers.
The film from Academy Award-nominated filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin documents how the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision helped pave the way for secret political spending by players like the Kochs,  who contributed directly and indirectly  to the election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in 2010 and  came to his aid again  when the battle broke out over his effort to limit collective bargaining. 
Originally slated to appear on PBS stations nationwide as part of the "Independent Lens" series, "Citizen Koch" had its funding pulled after David Koch was offended by another PBS documentary critical of the billionaire industrialists.
"People like the Kochs have worked for decades to undermine public funding for institutions like PBS," Deal told the Center for Media and Democracy. "When public dollars dry up, private dollars come in to make up for the shortfall."
And that private funding can conflict with PBS' "public" mission and its editorial integrity. The PBS distributor "backed out of the partnership because they came to fear the reaction our film would provoke," Deal and Lessin said in a statement. "David Koch, whose political activities are featured in the film, happens to be a public-television funder and a trustee of both [New York PBS member station] WNET and [Boston member station] WGBH. This wasn’t a failed negotiation or a divergence of visions; it was censorship, pure and simple.”
"Park Avenue" Documentary Raised Koch Hackles
In November of last year, the New York PBS affiliate WNET aired a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney, "Park Avenue," that explored growing income inequality by contrasting the lives of residents in a luxury apartment building in Manhattan with individuals living on the other end of Park Avenue, in the Bronx. The film focuses on one of the apartment's wealthiest residents, David Koch, and does not paint a particularly positive image of the billionaire industrialist and his brother, Charles.
Koch is also a board trustee and major donor to WNET. And WNET's president called him before the documentary aired to alert Koch to the critical content -- and took the nearly unprecedented step of airing a disclaimer from Koch following the film calling it "disappointing and divisive." WNET also replaced the original introduction to the film, which had been narrated by actor Stanley Tucci, with one calling the film "controversial" and "provocative." 
“They tried to undercut the credibility of the film, and I had no opportunity to defend it,” the film's director Gibney told Mayer. "Why is WNET offering Mr. Koch special favors?"
Independent Television Service (ITVS), an arm of PBS that funds and distributes independent films, had funded "Park Avenue," and aired it as part of ITVS' popular "Independent Lens" series that runs on dozens of PBS member stations. ITVS also funded "Citizen Koch" and it was also slated to be aired on the Independent Lens series. 
But "Citizen Koch" got caught in the blowback.
Fearing Koch Backlash, Funding Pulled on "Citizen Koch"
ITVS was excited about the "Citizen Koch" documentary before "Park Avenue" aired. In April 2012, the company informed Deal and Lessin their film would receive $150,000, and that “Everyone here at ITVS looks forward to working with you on your very exciting and promising program.”
But once "Park Avenue" aired, WNET blamed ITVS for impacting its relationship with David Koch and not providing advance notice of the film's contents. Mayer writes: 
"[WNET President Neal] Shapiro acknowledged that, in his conversations with ITVS officials about 'Park Avenue,' he was so livid that he threatened not to carry its films in the future. The New York metropolitan area is the largest audience for public television, so the threat posed a potentially mortal blow to ITVS."
ITVS got the message, and quickly changed its tune on "Citizen Koch."
Lessin and Deal began receiving pressure from ITVS executives to change the title and de-emphasize the Kochs' political influence. One executive told the filmmakers the title was "extremely problematic" and that “we live in a world where we have to be aware that people with power have power.”
On a conference call in January, ITVS executives acknowledged the push-back from WNET over the "Park Avenue" film, and again urged the filmmakers to change the storyline. Sources told Mayer that what their message was "Get rid of the Koch story line ... Because of the whole thing with the Koch brothers, ITVS knew WNET would never air it."
"It is always a struggle for documentaries to get out there," Deal told CMD. "That's why PBS and ITVS are so important: they support independent filmmakers to say new things on the public airwaves." But because of funding pressures, "we won't have access to that audience now," he said. "We're disappointed."
PBS Reaction to "Citizen Koch" Proved the Film's Point: Money Talks
"Citizen Koch," which premiered at Sundance in January and competed for Best Documentary, followed the activism and struggles of former Republicans who felt betrayed by Walker's union-busting move (which he never mentioned on the campaign trail). The film documents the role of Koch-funded entities like Americans for Prosperity, which spent  $10 million  aiding Walker in his recall election. The film's final scene shows an Americans for Prosperity official making the incredible claim the group is "just like the Red Cross, just like any other nonprofit.”
In April of this year, one day after the film had its Dairy State premiere at the Wisconsin Film Festival, ITVS informed Lessin and Deal it had "decided not to move forward with the project."
In a statement, the filmmakers said this is an ironic turn: “It’s the very thing our film is about—public servants bowing to pressures, direct or indirect, from high-dollar donors.”
"I don't believe there was a concerted conspiracy to keep 'Citizen Koch' off of public television, with David Koch as a ringleader," Deal told CMD. "Instead, Koch's presence and role in that world created an environment that was hostile to our message. And that was enough." 
Just before Mayer's New Yorker article was published, on May 16, David Koch resigned from WNET's board. The resignation was the result, a source told Mayer, "of his unwillingness to back a media organization that had so unsparingly covered its sponsor."
As has been widely reported , the Kochs are now considering a purchase of eight major daily newspapers currently owned by the Tribune Companies. And that has Deal worried. 
"For anybody who says the owner or funder of an outlet doesn't have an impact on what gets published, I hope they'll think again."

A French farmer who can no longer perform his routine farming duties because of permanent pesticide injuries has had his day in court, literally, and the perpetrator of his injuries found guilty of chemical poisoning. The French court in Lyon ruled that Monsanto’s Lasso weedkiller formula, which contains the active ingredient alachlor, caused Paul Francois to develop lifelong neurological damage that manifests as persistent memory loss, headaches, and stuttering during speech.
Reports indicate that the 47-year-old farmer sued Monsanto back in 2004 after inhaling the Lasso product while cleaning his sprayer tank equipment. Not long after, Francois began experiencing lasting symptoms that prevented him from working, which he says were directly linked to exposure to the chemical. Since Lasso’s packaging did not bear adequate warnings about the dangers of exposure, Francois alleged at the time that Monsanto was essentially negligent in providing adequate protection for its customers.
To the surprise of many, the French court agreed with the claims and evidence presented before it, declaring earlier this year that “Monsanto is responsible for Paul Francois’ suffering after he inhaled the Lasso product … and must entirely compensate him.” The court is said to be seeking expert opinion on how to gauge Francois’ losses in order to determine precisely how much Monsanto will be required to compensate him in the case.
“It is a historic decision in so far as it is the first time that a (pesticide) maker is found guilty of such a poisoning,” said Francois Lafforgue, Paul Francois’ lawyer, to Reuters earlier in the year.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to alachlor can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, spleen, and eyes, and may lead to the development of anemia and even cancer. The EPA apparently views alachlor as so dangerous, in fact, that the agency has set the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) for alachlor to zero in order to “prevent potential health problems.” ( http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/alachlor.cfm )
In 2007, France officially banned Lasso from use in the country in accordance with a European Union (EU) directive enacted in 2006 prohibiting the chemical from further use on crops in any member countries. But despite all the evidence proving that alachlor can disrupt hormonal balance, induce reproductive or developmental problems, and cause cancer, the chemical is still being used on conventional crops throughout the U.S. to this very day. ( http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_ChemReg.jsp?Rec_Id=PC35160 )
“I am alive today, but part of the farming population is going to be sacrificed and is going to die because of (alachlor),” added Francois to Reuters.

By JOSHUA ROBERTS / joshr@laramieboomerang.com  Wednesday, May 15, 2013

A Laramie woman’s appearance Monday morning in Albany County Circuit Court didn’t take place as previously scheduled.
Meg Lanker-Simons, cited for interfering with a peace officer in connection with a social media controversy last month, is next set for a scheduling conference at 8:30 a.m. June 13 in Circuit Court.
Her attorney, Charles Pelkey, entered an appearance on her behalf and a not guilty plea in late April to the misdemeanor charge.
The charge stems from a UW Police investigation into a graphic, sexually-threatening comment posted on the Facebook page, UW Crushes.
Lanker-Simons was allegedly targeted in the comment. However, UW Police allege Lanker-Simons authored the comment.
“Subject admitted to making a controversial post on UW Crushes webpage and then lied about not doing it,” according to the citation.
The interference charge isn’t Lanker-Simons’ first experience with the local court system.
Documents outline radio station incident
According to court records, she was charged in November 2005 in District Court with aggravated assault. 
Lanker-Simons, then Meghan Michelena, pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2006 as part of a plea agreement, records indicate.
According to an affidavit, the charge stemmed from an incident in which Lanker-Simons walked into an Albany County radio station she’d been fired from with a Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun.
She confronted a man who had decided to terminate her, the affidavit reports. The man also told her, the court documents state, that she would not be rehired.
Lanker-Simons “pulled a semi-automatic pistol from her purse, waved the firearm around and pointed (the) firearm at (the man),” according to the affidavit.
The man, according to the affidavit, said he was “in fear for his life.” 
The radio station, the affidavit states, was evacuated.
Albany County Sheriff’s Office deputies made contact with Lanker-Simons as she was attempting to leave the area in her vehicle and detained her at gunpoint.
During an interview with deputies, Lanker-Simons “admitted to having (a) gun in (her) purse and pulling it out and waving it around (the) victim,” according to the affidavit.
She was sentenced to six years of probation in July 2006. 
The probation sentence was subject to numerous stipulations, including refraining from owning firearms, undergoing counseling, paying fines and fees, completing community service and submitting letters of apology to victims.
Later in 2006, she pleaded no contest to an attempt to revoke her probation. 
Court documents state she violated probation by being “unsuccessfully discharged” from a residential treatment program.
In April 2007, she was again sentenced to probation with the stipulation she complete a treatment program in Utah.
Web page removed
Last week, an online page at www.wepay.com seeking donations for Lanker-Simons’ medical expenses was removed.
On the page, she wrote she was seeking “donations because emergency surgery to remove an appendix time bomb has left our budget stretched beyond the breaking point,” according to a narrative explaining the monetary request.
“We’re finding it impossible to cover medical bills, pay rent and utilities, buy groceries and though I’ve been looking for full-time work, it’s been difficult to find anyone who’s even hiring. My husband and I are both working and going to school, but it’s just not enough.”
Since she was cited in the UW Crushes controversy, Lanker-Simons has referred questions to her attorney.
Pelkey said the wepay.com request was posted in February and gained recent attention because of a right-wing blog.
“Certainly this case has gotten a lot of attention, and there are a lot of people with a lot of opinions on both sides,” he said last week. “And, I would imagine there are people out there who believe Ms. Lanker did what she’s accused of doing and disagree with her politics.
“The assertion is she’s using it to raise money for her defense fund and fraudulently claiming that she needs a procedure. She did need the medical procedure, she got the medical procedure (and) she used funds because she’s a low-income person and got assistance.”
The wepay.com page had raised at least $2,400 before it was taken down.
Pelkey said his client has a full accounting of the donations and receipts for her medical expenses.
“We’re all in the position of having major expenses, really, for a major medical condition and she came up with a unique way of raising funds for it,” he said.
“Basically, her life has always been an open book online.”
Lanker-Simons, according to UW, participated Saturday in the College of Arts and Sciences’ commencement ceremony. 
She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Police Tase Foreclosed Upon Homeowners Protesting Criminal Bankers, Criminal Bankers Continue Facing No Repercussions
Why shoot peaceful protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant?
Taser International's X2 two-shot Taser for law enforcement is displayed in January. The US Supreme Court refused to review the use of Taser stun guns by police on two women, including one who was seven months pregnant at the time.
May 21, 2013  |  
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
 
You may have heard about the protests at the DOJ by foreclosed upon homeowners demanding that Eric Holder prosecute some bankers for their criminal activity. If you haven't,  you can read all about it here.  
Unfortunately, I received reports last night that citizens exercising their right to peacefully protest were being casually tasered by the authorities. 
This came from my friend Jason Rosenbaum, who was there:
At the start of the action, when the protesters and homeowners arrived at the south entrance of the DOJ, we were greeted by half a dozen police in tactical gear or uniforms and a metal barrier cutting off access to a small courtyard in front of the large DOJ doors. The group of protesters rallied at the barrier and the planters next to it that made up the square and homeowners slowly climbed over the barriers in an attempt to gain an audience at the DOJ and register their complaints. At that point, the police were keeping people from climbing over, but eventually the police retreated and a few homeowners and protesters made it over and sat down to occupy that space. More joined them. After about 10 minutes, as more climbed over the barrier and the crowd occupied more space, the police retreated up the few steps leading to the door, and eventually ceded the square entirely by going inside the DOJ, leaving the protesters and homeowners alone in the square. The protesters took down the barriers at that point and everyone occupied the square, complete with signs, chants, couches, tents, and the like. (There's video/photos of this on my Twitter feed, @j_ro.)
That was phase one -- for the next phase, the protest split into three groups, with one staying at the south entrance and the two others to take entrances on the north and west sides of the building. I went with the group going to the west, and we were met again by police presence at the west entrance. We pushed on through to the north entrance around the block, and again were met by police. After sitting down there for a bit and taking the intersection down the block, we were notified that our brethren needed our help back at the south entrance and we marched over.
When I got there with the crowd in my group, the police had about a dozen homeowners in plastic cuffs on the south steps and had set up a police line around the original square in front of the door. The people in my group rushed through the line to sit down with their fellow protesters and homeowners being arrested, and it was at this point that at least one officer took out his taser gun, pulled the trigger, and started using it to push back those in the crowd coming to the support of those being arrested. That's what you see in my video. As Matt noted, it was over very quickly, with protesters looking to peacefully support those who were being arrested being tased and pushed back, and those being arrested led into a police van and driven away for processing.
At this point, as the arrests were being loaded into the van, another group of about a dozen sat down inside the police barrier and as far as I know they're still there (I had to leave about an hour after the initial arrests). So there may be more arrests to come shortly.
There is nothing new about protesters gathering at government buildings. And it has never been a problem for the police to arrest protesters in an orderly fashion, even when the protesters are not cooperating by sitting down and refusing to move. This is the way civil disobedience has worked for many a moon. 
Shooting protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant, however, is new. And it's completely unnecessary, not to mention contrary to our long tradition of peaceful protest. I thought this sort of thing went out with the use of firehoses and police dogs.
It happened again today, this time well captured on video:
 
Note the casual sadism. The young woman is surrounded by three men as she links arms with another protester. She does not appear to be in any way violent or threatening. The big man behind her holds her around the neck and whispers in her ear (who knows what he told her, but if it's the usual, he says "cooperate right now or you're going to be tased.") As a peaceful protester engaged in civil disobedience she naturally refuses. At this point, they would normally pick her up bodily and carry her to the paddy wagon. Instead, they hit her with 50,000 volts of electricity, she crumbles to the ground as her whole body is overwhelmed by pain. 
And then they blithely walk away, leaving her writhing on the ground. Let's just say they were lucky she wasn't one of the thousands of people who've died from tasers. I guess they would have noticed at some point when she stopped screaming. 
This makes me sick to my stomach. And that it happened on the steps of the United States Department of Justice makes me ashamed to be an American. 
The woman who was tasered is named Carmen Pittman.  Here's her story.  I guess she just hasn't been punished enough.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Patrick Leahy withdrew his proposed amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have recognized the marriages of same-sex couples for immigration purposes on Tuesday night, after several Democratic members of the committee stated that they would not be supporting it.
A little past 7 p.m., Leahy said, “It is with a heavy heart … I will withhold the Leahy Amendment 7 at this point.”
Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offered the amendment a half-hour earlier, saying, “I don’t want to be the senator who asks Americans to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country.”
He added, “Discriminating against people based on who they love is a travesty,” noting that he wanted to hear from members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators about why they didn’t include protections for gay couples in the initial bill.
Sen. Lindsey Graham went first, saying he opposed the inclusion of gay couples’ protections in the bill, despite noting his respect for Leahy’s “passion” is support of marriage equality.
“If you redefine marriage for immigration purposes [by the amendment], the bill would fall apart because the coalition would fall apart,” Graham said. “It would be a bridge too far.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein cited Graham’s comments, then, saying of Leahy’s amendment, “I think this sounds like the fairest approach, but here’s the problem … we know this is going to blow the agreement apart. I don’t want to blow this bill apart.”
She cited the fact that the Supreme Court could strike down the Defense of Marriage Act provision that prevents same-sex couples from having equal immigration rights in coming months. She also noted the a bill she is sponsoring to repeal DOMA is holding in the Senate, concluding, “I would just implore to hold up on this amendment at this time.”
Sen. Jeff Flake, another Republican in the Gang of Eight, said, “It certainly would mean this bill would not move forward.”
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic member of the Gang of Eight, then spoke up, praising Leahy’s leadership, but concluding, “I believe that this is the wrong moment, this is the wrong bill.”
Sen. Chuck Schumer went last of the four members of the Gang of Eight on the committee, saying, “This is one of the most excruciating decisions I have had to make in my [time] in Congress. … Not to do this is rank discrimination.”
He then said, however, of opponents of inclusion, “They’ve made it perfectly clear that if this provision is included … they will abandon [the bill.] … If we make the effort to add it to this bill, they will walk away. … The result: no equality, no immigration bill, everyone loses. … Much as it pains me, I cannot support this amendment if it will bring down the bill.’
“I will be here,” Schumer said to the LGBT community, to work on the issue in the future. “This is far from our last battle together.”
Sen. Al Franken, likewise, joined in the decision not to support the amendment, saying, “This is the definition of a Hobson’s choice. … It’s wrong to discriminate against people, but I do not want the LGBT people who would be hurt by this bill not passing, this whole bill not passing, to be hurt by this falling apart.”

2013-05-20T22:00:02Z
There is no standard definition of the all-important term “wing nut,” so let’s provide one. A wing nut is someone who has a dogmatic commitment to an extreme political view (“wing”) that is false and at least a bit crazy (“nut”).
A wing nut might believe that George W. Bush is a fascist, that Barack Obama is a socialist, that big banks run the Department of the Treasury or that the U.S. intervened in Libya because of oil.
When wing nuts encounter people with whom they disagree, they immediately impugn their opponents’ motivations. Whatever their religion, they are devout Manicheans, dividing their fellow citizens into the forces of light and the forces of darkness.
Wing nuts have a lot of fellow travelers -- people who don’t fit the definition, yet who are similarly dogmatic and whose views, though not really crazy, aren’t exactly evidence-based. You can be a wing nut on a particular issue without being a wing nut in general. Most human beings can hear the voice, at least on occasion, of their inner wing nut.
The good news is that wing nuts usually don’t matter. The bad news is that they influence people who do. Sadly, more information often fails to correct people’s misunderstandings. In fact, it can backfire and entrench them. Can anything be done?
Stunning Conclusion
For a positive answer, consider an intriguing study by Philip Fernbach, a University of Colorado business school professor, and his colleagues. Their central finding is that if you ask people to explain exactly why they think as they do, they discover how much they don’t know -- and they become more humble and therefore more moderate.
The study came in four stages. First, people were asked to state their positions on a series of political issues, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, a national flat tax, merit-based pay for teachers and unilateral sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. They were asked to describe their position on a seven-point scale whose endpoints were “strongly in favor” and “strongly opposed.”
Second, people were asked to rate their degree of understanding of each issue on a seven-point scale. The third step was the crucial one; they were asked to “describe all the details you know about [for example, the impact of instituting a ‘cap and trade’ system for carbon emissions ], going from the first step to the last, and providing the causal connection between the steps.” Fourth, people were asked to rerate their understanding on the seven-point scale and to restate their position on the relevant issue.
The results were stunning. On every issue, the result of requesting an explanation was to persuade people to give a lower rating of their own understanding -- and to offer a more moderate view on each issue. In a follow-up experiment, Fernbach and his co-authors found that after being asked to explain their views, people were less likely to want to give a bonus payment to a relevant advocacy group.
Interestingly, Fernbach and his co-authors found no increase in moderation when they asked people not to “describe all the details you know” about the likely effects of the various proposals, but simply to say why they believe what they do. If you ask people to give reasons for their beliefs, they tend to act as their own lawyers or public relations managers, and they don’t move toward greater moderation. The lesson is subtle: What produces an increase in humility, and hence moderation, is a request for an explanation of the causal mechanisms that underlie people’s beliefs.
Motivated Reasoning
In an unnoticed essay, the economist Albert Hirschman lamented the “overproduction of opinionated opinion.” He feared that strong opinions, as such, “might be dangerous to the health of our democracy,” because they can make it harder for people to understand one another and to find mutually agreeable solutions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are to be believed, the problem is curable -- at least if those who have “opinionated opinions” have less than solid foundations for their beliefs and if they can be convinced of that fact.
For wing nuts and their many fellow travelers, however, there is a serious obstacle, and it goes by the name of “motivated reasoning.” When people have a strong emotional attachment to their initial convictions, they tend to heap ridicule on anything that runs counter to those convictions and to give a lot of weight to anything that supports them.
Motivated reasoning helps to account for two defining characteristics of wing nuts and their fellow travelers: a readiness to attack people’s good faith, rather than their actual arguments, and an eagerness to make the worst, rather than the best, of opposing positions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are right, this obstacle may not be insuperable. Serious efforts to examine the assumptions behind your own beliefs, and to identify what you don’t know, are likely to produce an increase in humility. Whether or not you change your view, you may well be humbled -- and end up being a bit more charitable to those who see things differently.

WASHINGTON | Tue May 21, 2013 5:50pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid expressions of horror, grief and resolve over the devastating tornado that smashed into suburban Oklahoma City, many lawmakers expressed relief on Tuesday that they took action in January to bulk up the FEMA disaster relief fund.
But Oklahoma's two senators, both Republicans, found themselves in an awkward position for having voted against the $60 billion supplemental appropriation bill that was largely aimed at providing relief to victims of Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into coastal New York and New Jersey last year.
The bill left the disaster fund run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a healthy balance of $11.6 billion. FEMA spokesman Dan Watson said the amount is sufficient for handling immediate response and recovery efforts in Oklahoma and residual recovery costs associated with Sandy.
In January, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe called the Sandy appropriations bill a "slush fund" because it included long-term infrastructure spending and funding for projects aimed at disasters other than the devastation along the U.S. East Coast.
The measure became embroiled in a tense budget fight over the "fiscal cliff" tax hikes in January and was delayed for several weeks for tempers to cool as FEMA's disaster fund rapidly dwindled.
On Tuesday, a day after a 2-mile (3-km) -wide tornado wiped out whole blocks of homes, killed at least 24 people and left thousands homeless in Moore, Oklahoma, Inhofe vowed that Oklahomans in need would not abuse federal disaster aid, as he said had occurred in the aftermath of Sandy.
"That's totally different," Inhofe told cable TV network MSNBC. "Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in Oklahoma."
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who also opposed the Sandy appropriation because it was not offset with budget savings elsewhere, pledged to make a similar "pay-for" demand if further disaster funds were needed. For now, however, he was focused on getting aid to the victims.
"As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I can assure Oklahomans that any and all available aid will be delivered without delay," Coburn said in a statement.
Representative Tom Cole, the Republican congressman whose district bore the brunt of the tornado - its second major disaster due to a twister in 14 years - had no explaining to do. He supported the Sandy legislation and pledged whatever resources were necessary to recover and rebuild devastated communities.
Cole, a moderate Republican with a reputation as a pragmatist, earned notoriety during the budget talks late last year as the first member of his party to advocate allowing higher tax rates on the wealthy in order to prevent tax increases on the vast majority of Americans.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he also helped trim some provisions from the Sandy bill that were unrelated to that disaster.
"I am confident we will get the help we need to make it through this tragedy. That is what Americans do for other Americans in tough times and challenging circumstances," Cole said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski, also a Democrat, both pledged that if more money was needed for Oklahoma City, they would take action to fund it.
"This is a time for neighbor helping neighbor. This is not the time for a 'budgeteering' battle. This is a time to respond with compassion and competence," Mikulski of Maryland said in a statement.

Budget request calls for $200m to go towards military construction to upgrade temporary facilities at the prison.
Last Modified: 22 May 2013 00:07
Since his inauguration in January 2009, US President Barack Obama has pushed for shutting the prison [AFP]
The Pentagon is asking Congress for more than $450 million for maintaining and upgrading the Guantanamo Bay prison that President Barack Obama wants to close.
New details on the administration's budget request emerged on Tuesday and underscored the contradiction of the president waging a political fight to shutter the facility while the military calculates the financial requirements to keep the installation operating, AP news agency reported.
The budget request for the fiscal year beginning October 1 calls for $79m for detention operations, the same as the current year, and $20.5m for the office of military commissions, an increase over the current amount of $12.6m. The request also includes $40m for a fiber optic cable and $99 million for operation and maintenance.
The Pentagon also wants $200m for military construction to upgrade temporary facilities. That work could take eight to 10 years as the military has to transport workers to the island, rely on limited housing and fly in building material.
The facility at the US naval base in Cuba currently holds 166 prisoners, and hunger strikes by 100 of them over their indefinite detention and prison conditions prompted Obama to renew his effort to close Guantanamo.
'Not necessary'
The president is expected to discuss the future of the facility in a speech on counterterrorism on Thursday.
"Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe," the president said at a White House news conference last month. "It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."
Since his inauguration in January 2009, Obama has pushed for shutting the prison, signing an executive order for closure during his first week in office. He has faced resistance in Congress with Republicans and some Democrats repeatedly blocking efforts to transfer terror suspects to the United States.
The law that Congress passed and Obama signed in March to keep the government running includes a longstanding provision that prohibits any money for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States or its
territories. It also bars spending to overhaul any US facility in the US to house detainees.

Siena, Italy—Here’s a modest idea to break the gridlock, the stupidity, the meanness, the partisan lying and irresponsible ineffectiveness of modern Washington. We should consider returning to the Middle Ages.
Siena today is a small city of about 50,000 people, not much bigger than it was at its peak in the late 13th century. In those good and bad old days, it was a major manufacturing, mostly wool, and commercial center in Tuscany. The bad things were the Black Death—the plague of 1348, which wiped out more than its inhabitants, reducing it to a population that might have been as low as 16,000—and its repression by a larger neighbor, Florence. The good thing was that it was prevented from growing by those great troubles. Because of losing its struggles with its northern neighbor, much of Siena is still a beautiful and preserved city of the 14th century.
The other good and interesting thing about the city is how it was governed from 1277 to 1355. The largest building on the city’s spectacular oval Piazza del Campo, then and now, is the Palazzo Pubblico, were the city was governed by the "Nove," nine men selected by lottery and locked in the palace for two months at a time.
The idea: to keep away outsiders and outside influences—we call them special interests, lobbies and lawyers—as the "councillors" debated the problems and future of their city and then wrote its laws. The motives: to reduce the power of the Catholic Church, the richest institution in the area, and the power of aristocrats, members of the 56 families exercising military and commercial power.
One of the rooms in the palace, the "Sala della Pace," the room of peace, where the nine gathered, was decorated by murals—still visible today—showing dramatic instances of good and evil in government. The "Good Government" paintings show peace, prosperity and the virtues of Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, Prudence and Magnanimity—and, of course, Faith, Hope and Charity.

The "Bad Government" paintings show murder in the streets, soldiers carrying away women, and Justice bound in the chains of Tyranny.
Looked good to me. Unfortunately, the Council of Nine was overthrown by aristocrats and soldiers of Florence, who blamed the Nine for the plague destroying the city.
So where are we today in Washington? What will people hundreds of years from now think of our national governance with all its blaming, nastiness and negativity? It looks as if our country is being run by thugs and liars motivated by revenge and pettiness beyond description.
Our leaders are obsessed, it seems, with peripheral "scandals" and misjudgments, public relations arguments, talking points and plain old nonsense. A relevant critique of the current state of affairs in the IRS "scandal" was published a week or so ago by Michael Hiltzik, the economic columnist of the Los Angeles Times:
"It’s strange how ‘scandal’ gets defined these days in Washington. At the moment, everyone is screaming about the ‘scandal’ of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.
"Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.
"The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations."
I’m with him. Lock up the leaders of our Republic and force them to deal with real issues—and with each other.

The bizarre behavior by the media giant reflects brewing tensions as it seeks to enter the US television market
A general view shows the newsroom at the headquarters of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera English-language channel in Doha in this February 7, 2011 Photograph: Fadi Al-Assaad/REUTERS
(Updated below)
Last Tuesday, Al Jazeera English published a lengthy Op-Ed by  Columbia professor and Middle East scholar  Joseph Massad entitled "The Last of the Semites." Massad's argument was obviously controversial: he highlighted the shared goal between the early Zionist movement and Europe's anti-Jewish bigots (namely, the removal of Jews from the continent), detailed the cooperation between German Nazis and Zionists to facilitate the departure of Jews out of Europe (the existence of that cooperation is  not in dispute, though the extent of it very much is ), and highlighted the extensive disagreements among Jews themselves over the wisdom and justness of Zionism (large numbers of European Jews were insistent that they did not want to, and should not have to, leave their homelands for a distant land that was not theirs).
Predictably, numerous commentators -- largely the ones who have spent years  casually smearing as anti-semites  those who criticize Israel -- instantly and vehemently denounced Massad's arguments. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg  sarcastically tweeted : "Congratulations, al Jazeera: You've just posted one of the most anti-Jewish screeds in recent memory," while the editor of the neocon journal Commentary, John Podhoretz,  wrote : "Congratulations, donors to Columbia University, for paying this monstrous []head's salary!" A blogger for the Jerusalem Post  claimed that  " Massad's writings  on Israel can easily be confused with material from the neo-Nazi 'White Pride World Wide' hate site Stormfront."
All of that is par for the course when it comes to debates over Israel and Palestine: as any writer who ever ventures into that topic well knows, nothing triggers greater venom and personalized attacks (and a  greater risk of losing one's job ) than opining on any of these matters. And the critics of Massad's Op-Ed were doing nothing wrong per se: it's perfectly appropriate to harshly criticize controversial arguments that are published in a major media outlet. An intense debate was triggered about Massad's thesis, just as Massad and his Al Jazeera editors undoubtedly anticipated, and that is what opinion journalism often does and should do.
But all of that changed on Saturday. Without issuing any comment or explanation of any kind, unknown officials at Al Jazeera ordered Massad's Op-Ed to be deleted -- in essence, silently retracted. I actually discovered this deletion because, aware of the controversy that had erupted, I attempted on Saturday to read Massad's Op-Ed. But none of the specific Al Jazeera links I found would work: they all went to Al Jazeera's home page, which said nothing about Massad's Op-Ed. I finally was able to read the Op-Ed only by  finding it on blogs  which had re-printed the Op-Ed in full (a pdf version of how it appeared on Al Jazeera's site can be found  here ).
As a result, on Saturday morning I  asked on Twitter  whether Massad's Op-Ed had been deleted by Al Jazeera, and emailed several people who I believed had contacts with Massad and Al Jazeera to make the same inquiry. One of them, Ali Abunimah, then spoke with Massad and  reported  that Massad "had 'received confirmation' from his editor at Al Jazeera English that 'management pulled the article.'" Someone on Twitter  advised me  that the article could still be read in the mobile version of Al Jazeera's site, which I then  noted on Twitter , but by the end of that day, that, too, had been deleted. That Al Jazeera silently deleted an Op-Ed that it itself had published was then beyond dispute. In an email interview with me on Monday, Massad confirmed that his editor at Al Jazeera -- who had solicited Massad to write an Op-Ed for  Nakba Day  -- did not even know that it had been removed, and had to make several calls to confirm that it had been.
I spent much of the weekend emailing various Al Jazeera officials for comment, to no avail. Everyone either ignored my multiple inquires or said they were barred from commenting and referred me to the head of the outlet's PR department, who never responded. How can a media outlet possibly publish an Op-Ed, quietly delete it six days later in response to controversy, and then fail to utter a single word about what happened? Was there a fabrication or some glaring, retraction-worthy error in Massad's Op-Ed? Was it a mistake for Al Jazeera to have published it in the first place, and if so, who made that mistake, what was it, and why did it happen? Who made the decision to take the extraordinary step of deleting the Op-Ed, and what was the rationale for doing so?
No media outlet can possibly do something like this without publicly accounting for what happened and expect to retain credibility. How can you demand transparency and accountability from others when you refuse to provide any yourself? Refusing to comment on secret actions of this significance is the province of corrupt politicians, not journalists. It's behavior that journalists should be condemning, not emulating.
Media outlets do occasionally retract stories or even Op-Eds, but they then provide an explanation. Earlier this year, the Observer published a repellent Op-Ed by the British columnist Julie Burchill, which contained all sorts of ugly slurs against transgendered people (it was also published in the Guardian's online Comment is Free section). In the wake of intense condemnation, the Observer decided  to retract the Op-Ed and remove it from the site . The paper's editor, John Mulholland,  issued a statement  explaining the retraction, and the paper's readers editor (the rough British equivalent of an ombudsman), Stephen Pritchard, then wrote  a detailed account  of what happened.
Although I  condemned  the original Op-Ed, I did not agree with the decision to delete it. For one thing, it's a futile gesture: in the internet age, everything published is permanent. For another, it's contrary to the journalistic ethos: although it would have been appropriate to decide in the first instance not to publish it, once a decision is made to publish something, it should not be removed merely because it provokes controversy or even offense. Retractions should be reserved for serious factual errors. But at least the Observer transparently explained its actions and provided an account of what it did.
I'm not expressing any views here on the merit of Massad's arguments because that's irrelevant to the issue of Al Jazeera's conduct. I have spent years, both  as a lawyer  and then a writer, objecting to the suppression of all sorts of views which I find repellent, from  anti-gay  and  anti-Muslim bigotry  to  Ann Coulter  and  Ezra Levant's bile  to  Mohammed cartoons  to  advocacy of violence . I am a firm believer that, for multiple reasons, it is far preferable to air and then debunk even the most offensive ideas than it is to suppress them.
It's one thing for a media outlet to decide in the first instance not to publish an opinion piece on grounds of quality; it's another thing entirely for them to retract one they decide to publish simply because it offends people. Offending people is a necessary part of journalism and the fact that something produces offense is not evidence that it is invalid. Having media outlets afraid to publish opinions which offend people is a menacing state of affairs that nobody should want.
Massad is a provocative and controversial intellectual. Both he and the Al Jazeera editors who published this Op-Ed undoubtedly knew that many people would find the arguments both infuriating and offensive. There is nothing wrong with that: that's what good journalism does. Massad's Op-Ed led to some very aggressive and forceful criticisms of his arguments --  see here for one example  -- and that's exactly how it should be.
But deleting Massad's Op-Ed does not make this debate disappear. He did not invent these views. Indeed, as History Professor Daniel Myers  wrote recently in the Daily Beast , Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, made similar claims recently and actually wrote his dissertation on this topic at a Russian university. Professor Myers is quite hostile to the Abbas/Massad claim about the Zionist movement, labeling it "an historiographical sin of commission that rests on a faulty grasp of context and a distorted reading of the sources at hand," but the view is prevalent and held among credible scholars and influential politicians. Even Myers writes that "it must be noted there were periodic contacts between Zionists and Nazis before and during the War." Specifically:
"For example, in August 1933, the Zionist Federation of Germany signed an agreement with the German government (and the Anglo-Palestine Bank) known as the 'Haavara' (Transfer) which allowed for the transfer of Jewish property from Germany to Palestine as a means of encouraging Jewish emigration there. And during the War, Zionist officials in Palestine and elsewhere pursued a number of ransom plans whose goal was the liberation of European Jews. Perhaps the most well-known of these plans was the 'Merchandise for Blood' proposal of 1944 according to which one million Jews would be exchanged for 10,000 trucks. The negotiations were conducted between Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer for Jewish Affairs, and the Hungarian Zionists Joel Brand and Rudolf Kasztner."
Myers argues forcefully that these episodes were so limited that they do not remotely support the broad claims of Massad and Abbas. That's fine: that's what debates about history can and should entail. If you find the views of Professor Massad and the Palestinian president offensive, then you should want those views debated, not silenced. The solution is to debunk them, not suppress them, since they're not going anywhere.
Al Jazeera's deletion of this Op-Ed, and especially its refusal to provide any explanation for what happened here, is significant beyond just this one episode. Several people who work for the outlet, none of whom was willing to speak for attribution due to  fear of retaliation by the network's officials , say that Al Jazeera officials have become much more cautious and fearful ever since they  purchased Current TV last December  for $500 million and prepared to enter the US television market under the brand name "Al Jazeera America" (as disclosure: I had some preliminary discussions several months ago with some Al Jazeera officials about the possibility of doing something for that new network, though it never advanced beyond that stage; I also covered the US election for Al Jazeera English from Doha, and have appeared many times on that network).
In particular, these sources say, the primary impetus for the removal of the Op-Ed came from Ehab al-Shihabi, who was  recently named  to head the American TV network. They say that he is petrified that angering "pro-Israel" factions in the US will bolster the perception of Al Jazeera as both anti-American and anti-Israel, thus dooming the network with both corporate advertisers and cable carriers and render it radioactive among mainstream politicians. Al-Shihabi, they say, went to the network's top executive in Doha,  Director-General Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani , and demanded the removal of the Massad Op-Ed.
The tensions here reflect a broader internal conflict about how Al Jazeera intends to position itself as it enters American television. Many (and I include myself in this) believe that Al Jazeera can be successful only if they provide something that no other US cable news outlet regularly provides: fearless journalism of the type the network has displayed in the past, unconstrained by (and liberated from) the orthodoxies of the two dominant political parties and the airing of a wide range of views, including those typically excluded by mainstream US political television.
But several Al Jazeera executives have adopted the view, seemingly the one that is prevailing, that it should instead replicate the failed CNN model of risk-averse, viewpoint-free, colorless, soul-less "straight news reporting." That Al Jazeera's  first announced prime-time host  was the extremely uncontroversial, long-time CNN employee Ali Velshi, and is  reportedly considering  a horde of former CNN and NBC executives to run the network, illustrates the risk-averse, CNN-copying path they seem to be taking. Silently removing Massad's Op-Ed and then refusing to comment on it is behavior perfectly in line with that mentality.
All of this takes place in the context of  increasing criticisms from multiple quarters , at times  including its own journalists , that the ownership of Al Jazeera by the Emir of Qatar has increasingly affected, and degraded, its journalism, rendering it a propaganda tool for the Qatari dictatorship's foreign policy. Most of that criticism in the past had been directed at its flagship network, Al Jazeera Arabic. By contrast, Al Jazeera English has, by all appearances, remained largely independent, consistently producing truly outstanding and brave journalism.
The question is whether this can continue now that Al Jazeera is seeking to establish a serious TV presence in the US. The Qatari regime is a  close American ally ,  hosting several vital US military assets  used to wage the war in Iraq. But the regime has come under criticism  from US officials  and  "pro-Israel" commentators  for its support of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. It is hard to see how a US television network owned by the regime in Qatar will regularly broadcast journalism that is truly adversarial to its close ally, the US government, or air commentary that offends influential political factions in the US.
It's certainly possible that Al Jazeera America can provide unique and important journalism: networks owned by governments can and do produce real journalism. American cable news -- drowning in mindlessly partisan outlets that are endlessly focused on trivial Beltway gossip, along with the fear-driven pointlessness of CNN -- could certainly use an independent and intrepid journalistic competitor. Al Jazeera English has some outstanding, fearless journalists and produces some high-quality shows. But that will only happen if it remains independent of the Qatari regime's foreign policy aims and is free to risk offending and alienating powerful people:  the hallmark of good journalism . That's what makes its silent deletion of Massad's Op-Ed so alarming and disappointing: it signals that the network is being driven by exactly the corrupting fears that preclude meaningful, independent journalism.
For his part, Massad is convinced that it is Al Jazeera's imminent entrance into the US television market that caused the deletion of his Op-Ed. He wrote to me by email:
"It seems to me that if any media outlet, which still holds on to any expression of ideas that deviates from the established 'truths' of the American mainstream press, seeks to enter the US mainstream market, it will have to pay the heavy price of surrendering its right to air out such ideas and submit to the highly restrictive political line of the mainstream American media, especially on Israel. AJE has clearly shown that it is willing to pay such a price.
"When in the past Al-Jazeera resisted paying such a price, its journalists were targeted and killed by the US invading forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it was refused entry into the American system by refusing it cable access. The road of concessions began in the middle of the last decade when Arabic Aljazeera TV under an inordinate amount of US pressure stopped referring to the US invading forces in Iraq as 'American forces' but, as the US dictated, as 'Coalition forces.' It has been a slippery slope since then.
"Surprisingly, however, when Al-Jazeera changed its editorial line from one that was critical of US policies and interventions in the Arab world following the Libyan and Syrian uprisings, I criticized them harshly in  an interview with the Washington Post , but they continued to welcome my articles. When I criticized the Qatari Emir in the second article I wrote for them, I was not censored, and when I harshly criticized Qatari foreign policy since the Arab uprisings began, which I did in a number of articles, I was also not censored.
"It is ironic, though not shocking, that it was my criticisms of Israel and its Western allies that would be banned. . . . essentially neutralizing the remaining critical edge which made Al-Jazeera popular inside and outside the United States."
The way in which corporate influences on media outlets -- in ownership, in the need for advertisers, in not offending cable carriers -- restrict the range of permissible debate is a complex and vital topic. But whatever else is true, this episode provides a fairly potent illustration of how corrupting and restrictive those influences can be.
UPDATE
Just a few moments ago, Al Jazeera posted  an editor's note from Imad Musa , its Online Head for Al Jazeera English, entitled "In the Massad case, we should have done better." He writes that "Al Jazeera has always demanded transparency from the centres of power around the world, and we demand it from ourselves as well." After noting that he is re-publishing Massad's deleted Op-Ed, which is indeed published in full following the Editor's Note, Musa writes:
"We should have handled this better, and we have learned lessons that will enable us to maintain the highest standards of journalistic integrity.
"Our guiding principle has always been 'the opinion and other opinion.' Our pages have always been -- and will always be -- open to the most thought-provoking thinkers and writers from across the globe.
"Al Jazeera does not submit to pressure regardless of circumstance, and our history is full of examples where we were faced with extremely tough choices but never gave in. This is the secret to our success."
The note is still rather opaque, as it does not explain what happened, why it happened or who is responsible. But credit is still due Al Jazeera for acknowledging and rectifying their obvious mistake and responding to critics, something many media outlets refuse to do under similar circumstances. I hope this incident makes future journalistic capitulations less likely -- not just for Al Jazeera but in general.

Crossing sacred lines in Washington
By    David Shribman
JewishWorldReview.com | You don't have to be a member of the Tea Party to be outraged over the Internal Revenue Service's special and unwarranted scrutiny of conservative groups. I'm not, and I am.
For four decades liberals have nursed hurts over the Nixon administration's use of the IRS to intimidate if not punish its political opponents. The very first item in Article II of the House Judiciary Committee resolution impeaching Nixon speaks of the "violation of the constitutional rights of citizens" and the improper examination of "confidential information contained in income tax returns."
One thing a second-term president wants to avoid is appearing in the same sentence with the word "Nixon," and so the IRS forays during the Obama years combined with the disclosure that the Justice Department obtained phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors puts the current administration in unusual peril.
Yes, the Nixon comparisons are superficial, and no, history never repeats itself, but yes, last week was a very bad one for President Barack Obama and portends rough weather ahead.
But these twin incursions into well-established rights -- violations of the trust and sense of fair-mindedness that government requires even if politics does not -- underline two principles that should be sacred, whether the president is a Republican or a Democrat, whether the timbre of the times is conservative or liberal:
Never mess with the work of an independent press. Never use the taxing authority of the government for political ends.
No two institutions of American governance are more precious and deserving of caution from officials who -- and here Republicans and Democrats are equally vulnerable to sin -- believe they have reason to deplore the one and abuse the other.
For generations Americans have been served by an independent press, which is one of the political and cultural distinctions of our civic life. And the entire functioning of our government requires that the power to tax--which both Daniel Webster and John Marshall equated in 1819 with the power to destroy -- be deployed with antiseptic fairness.
So there are two scandals here, and all Americans should be concerned about them both. But there is a third scandal unearthed by last week's events, and it comes under the familiar dictum, often attributed to fellow columnist Michael Kinsley, that scandal usually isn't about what's illegal, but what is legal.
Here is what is legal and at the heart of this month's contretemps: It is legal for 501(c)(4) organizations -- conservative groups such as the various permutations of the Tea Party as well as many liberal groups such as PrioritiesUSA -- to have tax exemptions under the claim that they are primarily involved in the promotion of social welfare. The promotion of social welfare is an elusive concept often having little to do with social welfare and often having to do with politics. Its virtue is almost always in the eyes of the beholder, if not the donor.
This is not a new issue in Washington. More than nine months ago, 10 Republican senators, including some regarded by Democrats as among the most open-minded and even-handed of their rivals, contacted Douglas H. Schulman, the IRS commissioner, to express concern that political factors were affecting the agency's activities.
Nine years ago the American Bar Association created a task force to examine this question and found there was "no statutory basis" for the principle "that social welfare does not include political intervention." Indeed, in 1990 -- smack in the middle of a Republican administration -- the director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Technical Division told a conference (and you can imagine what a lively, fun-packed convention this was):
"When it comes to political activities, that is, giving money to a candidate, telling people to vote for a certain candidate, the rule is that it has to be less than primary. If it's 49 percent of their income, that is less than primary."
That's the principle guiding the use of all that principal. But it's not a good one, as it allows all sorts of groups to raise enormous amounts of money and then devote 49 percent of it to political purposes without tax exposure. Some estimates put the ad spending by these tax-exempt groups at more than half a billion dollars during the last election cycle.
Last week an unusual breeze of fairness blew through the capital, often from unlikely sources. Consider these remarks from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada:
"There are these shadowy political groups masquerading as social welfare organizations in order to solicit anonymous donations from we don't know who -- big corporations and also wealthy people. That needs to stop. We do not know exactly how much money was spent in the last election by these groups, and I acknowledge most of the money was spent on the right wing, but there was plenty on the left wing."
Here is the scary thing: USAToday reports that the IRS approved nonprofit status for liberal groups at the same time it was denying that status for conservative groups. Rhetoricians at the University of Pittsburgh and Jesus College, Cambridge, have developed a theory of "keywords," and it doesn't take a Pitt or Cambridge degree to ascertain the political leanings of a group with a name such as Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, which received tax-exempt status at the time when Tea Party groups employing words such as "patriot" did not.
None of this is good for the Obama administration, which otherwise would have had something big to crow about last week. Revised nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office figures put the federal budget deficit at $642 billion. That marks a $203 billion improvement from earlier forecasts -- and eerily, $203 billion was the size of the 1981 deficit, expressed in today's dollars, that propelled Ronald Reagan into office.
But that wasn't the predominant discussion of the week. Instead, the talk was of how the administration breached some of the most sacred lines in American life. First Amendment purists are right that attacking press prerogatives is an attack on American values. And maybe conservatives are right about taxes, because the type of flat tax they espouse could help take the IRS out of politics and make all of these exemptions meaningless.

Submitted by Tyler Durden on  05/21/2013 11:54 -0400
Ben Bernanke
Two years ago, Zero Hedge first made the observation that the bulk of Fed reserves (also known simply as "cash created out of thin air" because money is first and foremost fungible no matter what textbook theoreticians may claim, and the only cash allocation preference is the capital allocation IRR analysis) had been parked not with US banks, but with foreign banks with US-based operations. We followed that with more analyses , showing explicitly how the Fed was providing a constant cash injection to foreign banks courtesy of the rate on overnight reserves which is the amount Fed pays to banks that hold reserves with it, as the bulk of reserves continued to end up with foreign banks - a situation set to become a huge political storm some time in 2014-2015 when the IOER has to rise and the Fed is "found" to have injected tens of billions of "interest" not into US banks but in foreign banks operating in the US, and which then can upstream the "profits" to insolvent offshore domiciled holding companies.
So it was our expectation that while if not slowing down its rate of money-creation (i.e., reserve-production) - something that won't happen for a long time as it would crash the stock market - the Fed's reserves would at least revert to being accumulated at US-based banks. No such luck. In fact as the latest H.8 report demonstrates, as of the most recently weekly data, the Fed's policies have led to foreign banks operating in the US holding an all time high amount of reserves, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time, or $1,033 billion to be precise.
This means that, as we expected several months ago, the only recipient of ongoing Fed money printing are not US banks, but foreign banks operating in the US. For those confused about the big picture, here is a chart showing the breakdown of cash held by big and small US banks as well as foreign banks, superimposed to total reserves created by the Fed since the start of the Great Financial Crisis. The correlation is 100%.
And just to prove that ALL the unsterilized cash from both QE2 and QEternity has essentially gone to support offshore banks, here is the conclusive chart showing the change in Fed reserves and cash held by foreign banks:
Finally, tying it all together, here is chart showing cash at US banks vs cash at foreign banks operating in the US. At $1.03 trillion in foreign cash, the Fed's policies have once again led to more cash being held by foreign banks than all cash held by domestic banks.
We are confident that we speak for all when we say: "Thank you Ben - insolvent foreign banks appreciate your ongoing QE2 and QEternity-funded generosity"

What about the GAO audit which showed $16.1 trillion in secret loans were made by the Federal Reserve between December 1, 2007 and July 21, 2010 to both domestic and foreign banks. Does that not count or are we supposed to forget about that by now Tyler?

To be fair the reason the printing presses have so much power is because of our military might.  I believe it is somewhere around 900 bases in around 150 countries.  We did take over the world and the presses are used to extract wealth.

Exactly why this will end badly. The Bernak must print to make up for our lack of production. To support our consumption the major export nations need a steady stream of  debt.  The problem is the Bernank is destroying the debt's buying power in order to fund our duel deficits. Eventually it will get kicked rejected by the suppliers.

Petraeus’s role in drafting Benghazi talking points raises questions
FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES - Former CIA director David Petraeus addresses a University of Southern California event honoring the military on March 26 in Los Angeles.

The controversy over the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attack last year began at a meeting over coffee on Capitol Hill three days after the assault.
It was at this informal session with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the ranking Democrat asked David H. Petraeus, who was CIA director at the time, to ensure that committee members did not inadvertently disclose classified information when talking to the news media about the attack.

“We had some new members on the committee, and we knew the press would be very aggressive on this, so we didn’t want any of them to make mistakes,” Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.) said last week of his request in an account supported by Republican participants. “We didn’t want to jeopardize sources and methods, and we didn’t want to tip off the bad guys. That’s all.”
What Petraeus decided to do with that request is the pivotal moment in the controversy over the administration’s Benghazi talking points. It was from his initial input that all else flowed, resulting in 48 hours of intensive editing that congressional Republicans cite as evidence of a White House coverup.
A close reading of recently released government e-mails that were sent during the editing process, and interviews with senior officials from several government agencies, reveal Petraeus’s early role and ambitions in going well beyond the committee’s request, apparently to produce a set of talking points favorable to his image and his agency.
The information Petraeus ordered up when he returned to his Langley office that morning included far more than the minimalist version that Ruppersberger had requested. It included early classified intelligence assessments of who might be responsible for the attack and an account of prior CIA warnings — information that put Petraeus at odds with the State Department, the FBI and senior officials within his own agency.
The only government entity that did not object to the detailed talking points produced with Petraeus’s input was the White House, which played the role of mediator in the bureaucratic fight that at various points included the CIA’s top lawyer and the agency’s deputy director expressing opposition to what the director wanted.
“What [committee members] were looking for was the lowest common denominator,” said a senior administration official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the editing process. “That’s not what the agency originally produced.”
Petraeus did not respond to e-mailed requests to clarify questions surrounding his role in drafting and reviewing the talking points. He resigned as CIA director in November after details of an extramarital affair became public.
The attack
At 9:42 p.m. Sept. 11, 2012, as violent anti-American demonstrations unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa over an anti-Islam video made in the United States, a group of armed men attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

http://hotair.com/archives/2013/05/21/report-oversight-on-irs-targeting-came-from-washington-all-along/|Report: Oversight on IRS targeting came from Washington all along
posted at 10:01 pm on May 21, 2013 by Mary Katharine Ham
The idea that this targeting practice was isolated in some off-shoot Ohio office was preposterous from the beginning. Even if no other office were involved, Cincinnati is the central office for clearing tax-exempt applications and has been since the late ’90s. Its location in Cincinnati just gave apologists a convenient way to imply it was not involved in carrying out a national policy.
Since the early days of this scandal, we’ve learned, even if it was buried in the Style section of the Washington Post, there was a “directive.”
Now, National Review‘s Eliana Johnson reports there was guidance from Washington’s Technical Unit after the directive:
From the outset, Internal Revenue Service lawyers based in Washington, D.C., provided important guidance on the handling of tea-party groups’ applications for tax-exempt status, according to both IRS sources and the inspector general’s report released in mid May.
Officials in the Technical Unit of the IRS’s Rulings and Agreements office played an integral role in determining how the targeted applications were treated, provided general guidelines to Cincinnati case workers, briefed other agency employees on the status of the special cases, and reviewed all those intrusive requests demanding “more information” from tea-party groups. At times, the Technical Unit lawyers seemed to exercise tight control over these applications, creating both a backlog in application processing and frustration among Cincinnati agents waiting for direction.
An IRS employee who asked not to be identified tells National Review Online that all members of the agency’s Technical Unit are based in Washington, D.C. A current list of Technical Unit managers provided by another IRS employee shows that all such managers are based at the agency’s headquarters on Constitution Avenue in the District of Columbia, and the IRS confirmed, in a testy exchange with National Review Online, that the Technical Unit is “based in Washington.”
An example of such routine elevation of a case to Washington was in the IG report, despite the IG’s testimony that the practice took place with “little or no supervisory review.”
On May 17, 2010, according to the IG report, Determinations Unit specialists in Cincinnati handling tea-party applications were instructed to “send additional information request letters to the Technical Unit for review prior to issuance.” Ten days later, the Technical Unit “began reviewing additional information request letters prepared by the Determinations Unit.”
The IG report indicates this became a source of frustration, and specialists in Cincinnati pressed for a streamlined approach. “Why does the Technical Unit need to review every additional information request letter when a template letter could be approved and used on all the cases?” they asked via e-mail. The Washington unit rejected this approach and, in February 2011, was developing individualized letters itself. According to the IG report, an update from the Technical Unit acting manager to the Determinations Unit manager indicated, “Letters were being developed and would be reviewed shortly.”
Meanwhile the ever-changing stories of the White House have lost…Howard Fineman:
We still don’t know the details of how the special scrutiny of conservative groups began in 2010, who approved it, or who first learned about it higher up at the IRS and the Treasury Department. The White House says that it knew nothing about the matter until the counsel received a heads up about the pending IG report.
And yet tea party and other conservative groups had been complaining about the IRS scrutiny since 2010, and IRS officials had publicly reassured members of Congress that there was nothing unusual or unwarranted going on.
With two winning presidential campaigns built on successful grassroots fundraising, with a former White House counsel (in 2010-11) who is one of the Democrats’ leading experts on campaign law (Bob Bauer), with former top campaign officials having been ensconced as staffers in the White House (David Axelrod, who left for the reelection campaign in early 2011, and Dan Pfeiffer among others), it’s hard to imagine that the Obama inner circle was oblivious to the issue of what the IRS was doing in Cincinnati.
That may well be true. Maybe they didn’t care one whit what the IG was going to say. But they sure haven’t been behaving that way in the last week.
Hey, at least now we know the federal government is intent on harassing law-abiding entities equally in one sense— from the most modest Kitchen Table Patriots to the riches of Apple . What were the flags for Apple? “Profit-seeking” and “success?” Did you notice how very loquacious Jay Carney was today during the White House press briefing about Apple’s tax situation despite his previous professions that the IRS is an “independent agency.” I wonder why it’s not “improper” for the White House to comment on an ongoing inquiry in this case, hm?

The reason people listen to this guy is the whole paranoid Us vs Them mentality. The media is clearly against us so they are a terrorist organization. I'm not sure if they understand what a terrorist organization is. The media needs to show the truth and reality a lot better, but it's not a terrorist organization. The media needs less bias. It's owned by corporations of course.﻿ As Jimmy Dore said "CNN shows the bombs taking off. Al-Jazeera show the bombs landing." We need more honesty.

Senator John McCain just interviewed Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company's taxes and offshore profits. 
But the kicker came at the end, when McCain stopped his line of questioning by asking, "Why the hell do I have to keep updating apps on my iPhone all the time?"
Cook responded, "Sir, we're trying to make them better all the time."
McCain does have a point. It's really annoying to pop open the App Store every time there's a new update. We wish iPhones worked more like Android phones in that respect, letting you update apps automatically.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), has introduced a farm bill amendment that would allow farming of industrial hemp.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced an amendment to the farm bill Monday that would allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, an aide told HuffPost.
The "Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2013" would exclude industrial hemp, which is not a drug, from classification as "marihuana," removing it from the federal laws against growing pot, and allowing for regulation by the states.
Wyden told HuffPost he planned to talk to Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who is floor-managing the farm bill, about the provision. "For me, what's important is that people see, particularly in our state, there's someone buying it at Costco in Oregon," Wyden said in a brief interview in the Capitol. "I adopted what I think is a modest position, which is if you can buy it at a store in Oregon, our farmers ought to be able to make some money growing it."
The amendment was cosponsored by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Its introduction follows a failed effort by the two Republican senators to insert a similar provision into the base of the bill. The attempt was blocked by Democrats, amid a flurry of palace intrigue, who insisted McConnell press forward with a vote. Inserting it into the bill would have made it more likely for the provision to become law. The floor approach will require 60 votes.
Wyden has long been an advocate for allowing American farmers to grow hemp, which he said will create jobs and economic growth.
Last June, he introduced a farm bill amendment that would allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, but couldn't get it to a vote.
“I firmly believe that American farmers should not be denied an opportunity to grow and sell a legitimate crop simply because it resembles an illegal one," Wyden wrote at the time . "I’m confident that if grassroots support continues to grow and Members of Congress continue to hear from voters then common sense hemp legislation can move through Congress in the near future.”
Several states, including Oregon, Vermont and Kentucky, already allow for hemp licensure, but need the federal law amended before farmers can begin planting.
"We are optimistic that the hemp amendment to the farm bill will pass and be attached," said Tom Murphy, the national outreach coordinator for Vote Hemp, which aims to legalize hemp farming. "We just received word from [farm advocacy group] Rural Vermont that Sen. Patrick Leahy will support the amendment."

Albany
The sheriffs thought they were being summoned to the Capitol to discuss ideas for changes to New York's gun control law, the SAFE Act. Instead, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told them to keep quiet.
Opposition to the new law has simmered in upstate areas since Cuomo signed the law in January. Many county sheriffs oppose it, particularly its expanded definition of banned assault weapons, and have spoken out around the state. In January, the New York State Sheriffs' Association wrote Cuomo with an analysis, and later suggested tweaks.
Cuomo invited its leaders to the Capitol last month, people briefed on the meeting said. The group included Sheriffs' Association Executive Director Peter Kehoe and Chemung County Sheriff Christopher Moss .
"We didn't get a response (to the analysis) from him, but we could tell after the budget was passed that none of those recommendations were taken into consideration," Moss said. "When we got there, we never got to the contents of the letter."
Instead, Cuomo pushed the sheriffs to stop publicly speaking out against the act, Moss said.
"The governor was of the opinion that the sheriffs around the state should not be interjecting their personal opinions in reference to the law," Moss said, adding that Cuomo said sheriffs can't do that and enforce the law.
One person briefed on the meeting said Cuomo threatened to remove sheriffs from office, a little-used power afforded the state's chief executive under the state constitution. Moss would not confirm this. He did say the meeting was heated at times, but overall he described it as "cordial."
Kehoe did not return calls, and Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi declined to comment. An administration official, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss a private meeting, "strongly" denied Cuomo had threatened to remove any sheriff.
Last week, the Sheriffs' Association as well as several elected sheriffs filed an amicus curiae brief supporting a federal challenge to the SAFE Act.
"We're not really protesting the law; we're protesting the methodology in which the law was forced upon the people without input of the people," said Livingston County Sheriff John York , a Republican who chairs the group's executive committee.
Erie County Sheriff Tim Howard has said he "won't enforce" the act.
Cuomo has said the law will "save lives."
The law broadened the definition of banned assault weapons, increased penalties for illegal gun possession, reduced public access to gun permit information and required mental health professionals to report concerns about a gun-owning patient who posed a risk of harming himself or others. It bans any magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds, and bars people from loading magazines with more than seven cartridges.
The bill was unveiled on Jan. 14 and passed through a "message of necessity" that waived a three-day waiting period. The Senate, led by a Republican-dominated coalition, passed the bill by a 43-18 vote hours after the text became public. The Democrat-dominated Assembly passed it the next day, and Cuomo signed it.
In the amicus brief, the sheriffs wrote: "Law enforcement's work is made more difficult attempting to enforce unclear laws that harm, rather than promote, public safety. The laws appear willfully blind to legitimate safety interests, and instead are tailored to impact, and negatively impact, law-abiding firearm owners."
Asked last week about the court brief, Cuomo said, "They're free to litigate — God bless America."
He did not directly say if he thought sheriffs should speak out against laws they enforce, but said, "They're politicians. They run for office, too."
On Monday, Cuomo said Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola was "not upholding the law" when he said last week he would refuse to release permit-holder information. The law allows permit holders to make their information exempt from state Freedom of Information Law disclosure if they apply and meet set criteria.
Merola, a Republican, said that sifting through the applications would take resources his office cannot spare. Instead, he will not release any pistol permit data.
"That's not for a county clerk to do on a blanket basis," Cuomo said. "You can't decide what the law is or change the law — their job is to enforce the law administratively."

The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Obama administration's media investigations on two fronts on Tuesday.
The CPJ board sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Deputy Attorney General James Cole protesting the Justice Department's secret probe into the Associated Press . The board--whose members include Christiane Amanpour, Lara Logan, Tom Brokaw, Victor Navasky, Michael Massing and the Huffington Post Media Group's editor-in-chief, Arianna Huffington--said that it was doing something rare:
Our board of directors rarely has seen the need to raise its collective voice against U.S. government actions that threaten newsgathering. Today, however, we do see that need: We write you to vigorously protest the secret seizing of phone records of The Associated Press. The overly broad scope of the secret subpoena and the lack of notification to the AP by the Justice Department represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States.
The CPJ added that the Justice Department had "set a terrible example for the rest of the world, where governments routinely justify intervention in the media by citing national security." The letter also demanded, as the AP has, that any materials obtained in the DOJ probe be returned immediately to the AP. (Read the full letter here .)
In a separate release , the CPJ said it was "alarmed" at the Justice Department's secret investigation into Fox News reporter James Rosen.
"U.S. government efforts to prosecute leakers by obtaining information from journalists has a chilling effect domestically and sends a terrible message to journalists around the world who are fighting to resist government intrusion," CPJ head Joel Simon said in a statement.

Exclusive: Pamela Geller calls for immediate halt of immigration by Muslims

The Washington Times reported Sunday that “the Homeland Security Department has granted legal status to 99.2 percent of all illegal immigrants who have applied under President Obama’s new non-deportation policy for young adults, according to the latest numbers released Friday.”
It’s another giant middle finger to the American people by the Obama administration, endangering national security and guaranteeing higher unemployment. Supporters of this policy, according to the Times, “say the high rate makes sense given the motivated pool of youngsters, known as ‘Dreamers’ because of the Dream Act legislation that would give them full citizenship rights.”
Yes, the motivated pool of youngsters like Al Harbi, the Saudi “person of interest” whose role in the Boston Marathon jihad bombing has never been adequately explained, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston jihad bomber himself, or Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari (building bombs to use on the home of George W. Bush, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, nightclubs and the homes of soldiers) or Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh (who plotted to bomb a New York synagogue and the Empire State Building) or Amine El Khalifi (who plotted a suicide bombing plot of U.S. Capitol) or Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis (who plotted to bomb the Manhattan office of the Federal Reserve Bank) and so many other highly motivated youngsters.
We have been importing jihadists for years now with Muslim immigration programs under the Refugee Resettlement program , diversity visas and religious visas . The Refugee Council USA says: “The U.S. has historically maintained a policy of admitting refugees of special humanitarian concern into the country.” Yet what that means in practice is very different from what most Americans would expect. It’s always a shock to people when they first find out how Refugee Resettlement works. Instead of giving refuge to the religious minorities that are persecuted, oppressed and subjugated under the Shariah, we are opening the floodgates to Islamic supremacists and jihadists.
And what most folks don’t know is that it’s the OIC -driven U.N. that decides who gets refugee status. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) determines which of the world’s “huddled masses” comes to the U.S. as humanitarian refugees. According to a 2008 report (and little has changed since then), “major refugee ‘hot spots’ include the Horn of Africa with Somalia, Darfur in the Sudan and Ethiopia, Iraq, Pakistan and Myanmar. The U.S. is the third-highest ranked country in terms of hosting refugees. The annual budget for the UNHCR is over $1.7 billion derived from government contributions, foundation grants and donations.”
Here’s the thing. Anthony Kimery reported in Homeland Security Today last week that “the threat of ‘homegrown’ and foreign jihadist groups and individuals plotting mass casualty attacks on U.S. soil has not weakened, despite degradation of al-Qaida Central (AQC). … Authorities said there is an exceptionally ‘heightened concern’ regarding intelligence that the successful radicalization of Muslims and new converts to jihad in the U.S. and throughout the West who’ve been involved in mass casualty plots and plotting has resulted in inspiring of a legion of ‘inspired’ new jihadists, many of whom are ‘quite willing’ to carry out mass casualty attacks, including suicide martyr attacks.”
This is a direct result of the huge influx of whole Muslim communities from jihad areas and nations into the U.S. since 9/11. The Obama administration is importing whole Muslim communities from Islamic countries like Somalia. The “diversity” immigration numbers are doubling , tripling in some months. This immigration must stop. Many of these devout Muslims do not assimilate. They agitate for jihad, and many return to Somalia (or Pakistan, Afghanistan) for training. Why are we importing hostile invaders?
We should be importing whole Christian communities or Hindu communities, etc., that are living (and dying) under the boot of the Shariah. I know several people (Jews among them) who are trying to get out of Europe and Canada, and they are prohibited from emigrating. These include the best of people, businessmen (who would bring jobs), doctors, etc. They have met years of red tape and denial. Further, I must field three or four emails a day from former Muslims in Egypt, Mauritania, Gaza, etc., begging me to help them escape their dangerous circumstances. Again, brick wall.
But jihadists with “insurgent histories”? Welcome. Why? “Refugee resettlement.”
My organization, the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), has called for an immediate halt of immigration by Muslims into nations that do not currently have a Muslim majority population, and with good reason. There is no chance of that being implemented anytime soon. But it may one day soon become a matter of our national survival.

By PAUL ELIAS Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO May 21, 2013 (AP)

A federal court Tuesday struck down Arizona's ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy absent a medical emergency.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the law violated a woman's constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is able to survive outside the womb. "Viability" of a fetus is generally considered to start at 24 weeks. Normal pregnancies run about 40 weeks.
Nine other states have enacted similar bans starting at 20 weeks or even earlier. Several of those bans had previously been placed on hold or struck down by other courts.
Judge Marsha Berzon, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel on the San Francisco-based court, said such bans before viability violate a long string of U.S. Supreme Court rulings starting with the seminal Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.
The judge wrote that "a woman has a constitutional right to choose to terminate her pregnancy before the fetus is viable."
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the ban into law in April 2012 after it was approved by the Republican-led Legislature. Supporters said the law was meant to protect the mother's health and prevent fetuses from feeling pain. U.S. District Judge James Teilborg ruled it was constitutional, partly because of those concerns, but the 9th Circuit blocked the ban from going into effect until it ruled.
Lawyers representing Arizona argued that the ban wasn't technically a law but rather a medical regulation because it allowed for doctors to perform abortions in medical emergencies. Berzon rejected that reasoning and deemed the legislation a law banning abortions before a fetus is viable.
"The challenged Arizona statute's medical emergency exception does not transform the law from a prohibition on abortion into a regulation of abortion procedure," Berzon wrote. "Allowing a physician to decide if abortion is medically necessary is not the same as allowing a woman to decide whether to carry her own pregnancy to term."
Berzon was joined by judges Mary Schroeder and Andrew Kleinfeld.
Supporters of the ban vowed to keep fighting.
"Given the compelling and important interest Arizona has in protecting the health and well-being of expectant mothers from the dangers of abortions after 20 weeks and to protect children in the womb from needless and horrific imposition of pain, we will seek review from the United States Supreme Court," said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, who argued in support of the ban before the court. "If the 9th Circuit cannot permit Arizona to act because of Supreme Court precedent, then the Supreme Court must change that precedent."
Republican State Sen. Kimberly Yee, who sponsored the legislation, said she "wasn't surprised" by the ruling because of the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation.
"I'm optimistic that the state will have a compelling argument if we move this before the Supreme Court," Yee said.
Yee said she is 20 weeks pregnant.
"I certainly have no doubt in my mind that the baby I'm carrying at 20 weeks is a life," she said.
The 9th Circuit's ruling is binding only in the nine Western states under the court's jurisdiction, and Idaho is the only other state in the region with a similar ban. A federal judge earlier declared Idaho's ban unconstitutional.
Janet Crepps, a lawyer who argued against the ban in court for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the ruling Tuesday affirmed a woman's right to an abortion before viability.
"These laws are all unconstitutional," she said. "This is not a close legal question at all. These laws are unconstitutional."

The tyrants of our modern age are smart enough not to declare themselves to be tyrants. They simply don't follow the rules that have been set for the common citizens. The other smart move that they have made is that the real tyrants don't put themselves in the supposed positions of power. Does anyone really believe that the President is the top of the food chain in Washington? But if the political puppets aren't the tyrants, then who are? The ones who can't get prosecuted for their crimes, obviously.

/ Facebook
(CBS) SEBASTIAN, Fla. - A Florida state attorney says the charges against Kaitlyn Hunt, an 18-year-old high school student who engaged in a same-sex relationship with a 15-year-old classmate, will not be dropped, despite petitions from the public, CBS affiliate WTSP reports.
PICTURES: Fla. teen charged over underage same-sex relationship
Hunt has been expelled from Sebastian River High School in Sebastian, Fla. and is charged with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery of a child 12 to 16 years of age as a result of the relationship.
The case began in February after the younger girl's parents notified authorities when Hunt turned 18. Since then, the story has garnered national attention for what some say is a gay rights issue.
Kelly Hunt Smith, Kaitlyn's mother, created a Facebook page to gain support for her daughter in an effort to get the charges dropped, the station says. The page, entitled "Free Kate," had over 30,000 members as of early Tuesday.
Smith posted on the page that the girlfriend's parents "conspired with police to entrap Katilyn" because they disapproved of the relationship.
A similar petition on Change.org was set up by Kaitlyn's father, Steven Hunt, and has more than 56,500 supporters calling for prosecutors to drop the charges.
Steven Hunt claims his daughter's relationship with the 15-year-old girl was consensual and that the girlfriend's parents went to police because they blamed Katilyn for their child's homosexuality, WTSP reports.
The Indian River County Sheriff's Office held a press conference Monday in response to the public's uproar.
"If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl, it would have been prosecuted the same way," Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said.
According to the station, Florida's law says any person who engages in sexual activity with a minor between the ages of 12 and 16 commits the crime of lewd and lascivious battery.
"The idea is to protect people in that vulnerable group from people who are older, 18 and above," Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th circuit, said, according to the station. "...The statute specifically says that consent is not a defense."
Colton said prosecutors will not drop the charges based on the public petition. He said this case exemplifies the purpose of the current law and added he would not support any effort to make consensual relationships among peers legal, the station reports.
"There's a big maturity difference between them," he said. "You're talking the difference between a senior in high school and a freshman in high school. That's what the law is designed to protect."
The second-degree felony charges are reportedly punishable by up to 15 years in prison and could require the individual to register as a sex offender. Colton told WTSP Hunt has until Friday to accept a plea agreement that would subject her to two years of house arrest followed by a year of probation.
According to an arrest affidavit obtained by WTSP, Kaitlyn and her girlfriend began dating in November 2012. The victim reportedly told police they began a sexual relationship and according to the report, the victim was 14 and Kaitlyn was 18.
As part of the investigation, Indian River county detectives reportedly a recorded phone call between the two high school students to develop grounds for an arrest. In the call, Kaitlyn told the girl she loved her, the station reports.

Apple and Corporate Taxes
by EILEEN APPELBAUM
A “territorial” tax system – in which overseas profits of U.S. corporations would be lightly taxed in the U.S. or not taxed at all – is likely to be the top tax reform proposal advocated by Apple CEO Tim Cook when he testifies before the Senate on Tuesday.
Apple – like hundreds of other high-tech and pharmaceutical companies that enjoy enormous profits from royalties or licensing agreements – is able to attribute these profits to offshore subsidiaries located in low-tax havens like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands even when sales revenue and profits are earned primarily in the U.S.
Under current law, these companies continue to owe taxes to the U.S. Treasury on these overseas earnings, as technically, the taxes have only been deferred. But the taxes don’t come due until the profits are repatriated – that is, brought back to the U.S. parent company. A territorial tax system would let these companies repatriate profits without paying the U.S. taxes they owe.
The argument in favor of allowing companies to repatriate offshore profits while paying no tax or a small tax in the U.S. is that corporations will put these funds to work here at home. The promised payoff is increased investment, increased employment and increased economic growth. There is good reason to be skeptical of this promise.
The U.S. tried just such a tax break in 2004, declaring a temporary tax holiday for offshore profits. According to a  report  by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, approximately one-third of offshore profits were repatriated in the following year. Academic studies, however, found no evidence that companies used the repatriated profits to increase investment or employment and no evidence that they increased economic activity.
Instead, they freed up other funds that these companies used for stock buybacks and to pay dividends to corporate shareholders. Indeed, many of the companies that benefited from the tax holiday on offshore profits actually reduced employment in the U.S.
It is also a myth that these profits are languishing in offshore in low-tax jurisdictions. According  to the Wall Street Journal, a lot of this cash is actually held in U.S. banks or invested in U.S. government and corporate securities. As long as these profits don’t come back to the parent company, they are not taxed in the U.S. But this cash is already at work in the U.S. economy – which undermines the argument that a territorial tax system would bring huge hoards of cash back for investment. The only thing companies can’t do with these funds is reward shareholders.
U.S. companies are supposed to account for offshore profits by setting aside funds to cover future tax liabilities when these profits are repatriated. Few companies actually do this. Most simply declare that the funds have been permanently invested overseas, which frees them from this obligation. Google, Oracle, Microsoft and numerous other companies have taken this route. As a result, these highly profitable companies owe very little in corporate income taxes.
Apple, which currently has $102.3 billion in offshore profits, has not taken advantage of this provision. Its accounts show that it has set aside billions of dollars to cover future tax liabilities on offshore profits. According to the Financial Times, Apple set aside  $5.8 billion  last year, 70 percent of its reported tax liability, for this purpose. This boosted Apple’s apparent corporate tax rate to 25.2 percent – far above Google, Microsoft and others – and spared the company the public outrage directed at highly profitable companies that pay little or no corporate income taxes. However, the $5.8 billion is an accounting entry that had no effect on the actual taxes Apple paid.
A territorial tax system would further increase incentives to locate jobs in low-tax countries, as profits earned in these countries could more easily flow back to U.S. shareholders. A better solution is to eliminate deferral of taxes on profits stashed offshore and, instead, to allocate taxes on profits based on its activity in various jurisdictions.
About half of U.S. states that have a corporate income tax use such a method for U.S. companies that operate in multiple states. Earlier this year, California adopted a sales-based corporate tax system that taxes companies that sell products or services in California, no matter where in the world they are located, based on the proportion of their total sales revenue generated in the state. This could serve as an example for tax reform that is both  simple and fair .

The Justice Department obtained the phone records for at least five different numbers used by Fox News as part of a leak investigation, the New Yorker revealed on Tuesday . In addition, the magazine reported, the DOJ acquired the records for two different White House lines.
The report, by Ryan Lizza, suggests that the investigation into Fox News journalist James Rosen was much wider than initially known. (Rosen was pursued in connection with a story he wrote about North Korea's nuclear program.) Quoting from court documents, Lizza writes that Ronald Machen, the US Attorney investigating the leak involving Rosen, seized the records for at least thirty different phone lines:
Two of the numbers begin with area code 202 and the exchange 456, which, according to current and former Administration officials, are used exclusively by the White House. (The phone number for the White House switchboard is (202) 456-1414.)
At least five other numbers targeted by the government include the area code 202 and the exchange 824. The phone number for the Fox News Washington bureau, which is publicly available, is (202) 824-0001. Rosen’s work phone number at Fox News begins with the same area code and exchange.
It is the second time in recent weeks that the DOJ has been found to have seized phone records as part of a leak investigation. The department, along with the Obama administration, has been met with stinging criticism for the zealousness and the scale of its probes. The scope of the Fox News subpoenas does not appear to have been as large as that of the DOJ's pursuit of the Associated Press. There, records for at least 20 phone lines were seized . Even so, the revelation will do nothing to weaken the belief of many journalists that the Obama administration has gone too far in its pursuit of leakers.

Comments (21)
One of the most powerful tools in the arsenal of the grass roots food freedom fight is social media. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and many more networks allow people to instantly connect and provide a platform for information to be passed on exponentially. Facebook and Google are the two biggest websites in the entire world, and their reach is nearly unlimited.
Last week,  the Monsanto Company made it very clear that they were under the gun via social media , and they went on the defense, weakly claiming that those who object with their toxic seeds and deadly farming methods were “elitist,” thereby attempting to undermine us as snobbish people who don’t see the big picture and who don’t care about world hunger.
This week, they’ve upped their game. Mysterious things have been occurring on the social networks: posts have disappeared, some posts are hidden from the timelines of readers, and trolls abound on pages promoting this weekend’s  March Against Monsanto , happening worldwide on May 25.
Like any cornered rat, the leviathan seed company can see the very large threat coming their way, and it appears that they are pulling out all the stops to fight as dirty as they can. But the movement against the company is so powerful, that despite paid-off politicians and billions of dollars in the war chest, Monsanto knows that they’ve been outmatched. What we’re seeing now are the last, desperate attempts to keep the general public from learning about the man-made global disaster that was created by Monsanto.
On my own page, I found an interesting anomaly. I posted this yesterday:
My children’s first protest march!!!
Any ideas for our signs?

The thing that was very strange about this is that, at the bottom, you can see, it only got 67 views nearly 14 hours after I posted it. The posts that I shared above and below it all had hundreds of views. I asked some friends to check their timelines, and this particular post did not show up. They had to actually go to the page and look for it to find it tucked in near the bottom.
If I hadn’t heard from Tami Canal, the driving force behind the  March Against Monsanto’s Facebook page , I would have thought it was merely a fluke. But mysterious things have been happening there as well.
“Events are disappearing, posts are being put on city event pages that say events are cancelled. In no way, shape or form, has ANY event been cancelled. I believe Monsanto is behind this. Some of the people on the page that are commenting have newly made profiles and seemingly these profiles were made strictly to cause problems and get a rise out of our participants on the page.”
Monsanto has openly carried on an internet war with anti-GMO activists for years. Back in 2002, Jay Byrne, the former director of Monsanto’s Internet outreach, had some advice for colleagues:
“…’think of the Internet as a weapon on the table. Either you pick it up or your competitor does, but somebody is going to get killed.’
While he was working for Monsanto, Byrne told the internet newsletter Wow that he “spends his time and effort participating” in web discussions about biotech. He singled out the site AgBioWorld, where he “ensures his company gets proper play”. AgBioWorld is the site on which “Andura Smetacek” launched her campaign.
The biotech companies know that they will never conquer new markets while activists are able to expose the way their operations damage food security and consumer choice. ” ( source )
The Monsanto Company’s current overt tactics are to try and polish their very tarnished image by portraying themselves as do-gooders set on feeding the world, while painting anti-GMO protesters as uncaring, selfish individuals that haven’t given hungry Third World residents a passing thought. Less overt are these guerrilla internet shills, causing divisiveness in the movement by starting arguments on forums and in comment threads on social media, and outright passing on misinformation.
Unfortunately, Facebook seems to have the back of the trolls.  Occupy Monsanto ‘s page was actually  banned for three days when the owner publicly outed  an abusive PM from a troll. The person who wrote the letter faced no repercussions from Facebook. Other anti-GMO activists have announced that their posts have been hidden or otherwise censored, just like mine was.
Despite the rumors started that events for this Saturday’s March Against Monsanto have been cancelled, or that times have been changed, this is absolutely untrue. Canal reiterated, “In no way, shape or form, has ANY event been cancelled.” If you are planning to go to an event, rest assured, the events will go on as planned, despite the sneaky tactics of a desperate company.
Keep calm and don’t allow yourself to be provoked on Saturday. Anti-GMO activists are on the side of “good” in this battle, so it’s important to keep to the high road. Expect the presence of agent provocateurs, lots of law enforcement, and devious tactics to try to discredit the movement. The keys to successful resistance are unity, information, and public perception.
According to an article on  Natural Society , Monsanto has allied with the notorious mercenary security group, Blackwater (now known as  Academi ) in the fight against anti-GMO protesters:
Monsanto and Blackwater are indeed working together to target anti-Monsanto activists and organizations. Known as far back as 2010, it was unveiled that Blackwater’s client list included Monsanto, Chevron, Walt Disney and many more. According to  documents obtained by Scahill , it was also revealed that Monsanto was willing to pay upwards of $500,000 in order for Blackwater to join anti-Monsanto activist groups and infiltrate the ranks. Furthermore, a number of internet-based tactics could be utilized as incognito PR for Monsanto, who undoubtedly knew opposition would mount against their GMO crops as more individuals became aware of the dangers.
Don’t expect Monsanto to play fair. Tami Canal doesn’t.
“I’m not really surprised by Monsanto and their tactics….their bottom line is at stake and as they have demonstrated time and again, profit is their main objective at any expense, whether it be humanity or the environment. I encourage our participants to remain peaceful on Saturday. Do not let the paid shills entice you to violence. March Against Monsanto is a peaceful campaign and our voices will resonate much more loudly if we remain calm.”
Saturday promises to be one of the biggest worldwide protests that has ever taken place, with over two million people signed up to attend marches all over the globe. My children and I will absolutely be taking part in the historic event. Make a sign and join in – there is sure to be  a March near you !

The Obama Justice Department has seized the phone records of numbers that are associated with White House staffers and, apparently, with Fox News reporters, according to a document filed in the case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, on October 13, 2011. Kim is a former State Department contractor accused of violating the Espionage Act for allegedly leaking classified information to James Rosen, a Fox News reporter. Ronald C. Machen, Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is prosecuting the case, has seized records associated with two phone numbers at the White House, at least five numbers associated with Fox News, and one that has the same area code and exchange as Rosen’s personal-cell-phone number (the last four numbers are redacted).
In all, Ronald C. Machen, Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has seized records associated with over thirty different phone numbers. In the filing that included the new information, the last four digits of each telephone line targeted by the Obama Administration are redacted. Two of the numbers begin with area code 202 and the exchange 456, which, according to current and former Administration officials, are used exclusively by the White House. (The phone number for the White House switchboard is (202) 456-1414.)
At least five other numbers targeted by the government include the area code 202 and the exchange 824. The phone number for the Fox News Washington bureau, which is publicly available, is (202) 824-0001. Rosen’s work phone number at Fox News begins with the same area code and exchange.
William Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney, told The New Yorker this afternoon, “Because that information is sealed, I can’t confirm the owner or subscriber for any of those records.” Asked if the phone numbers of any reporters had been targeted in the Kim investigation, Miller said he could not comment.
Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that, as part of the investigation of the Kim leak, Obama’s Department of Justice seized e-mails from Rosen’s personal Gmail account . In the search warrant for that request, the government described Rosen as “an aider, and abettor, and / or co-conspirator” in violating the Espionage Act, noting that the crime can be punished by ten years in prison. Rosen was not indicted in the case, but the suggestion in a government document that a reporter could be guilty of espionage for engaging in routine reporting is unprecedented and has alarmed many journalists and civil libertarians.
The document uncovered today suggests the government seized “call detail” records from Rosen’s work and cell phones, which would show whom he called, who called him, how long they spoke, and the times of the calls. The document suggests that the government was seeking only the subscriber records for the two White House numbers targeted, information that a government source said would include the name of the official who used the specific line.
Because the last four digits of each phone number are redacted in the government filing, it is impossible to determine who exactly was targeted by the Justice Department.
Here is the full list of the phone numbers included in the filing, which lists evidence that the prosecution was sharing with the defense:
(202) 506 (Comcast)
(202) 777 (ATT)
(212) 601 (ATT) ( According to NewsCorp , the main number for the Fox Business Channel is (212) 601-7000.)
(202) 549 (ATT Wireless) (Rosen’s cell phone begins with these digits.)
(202) 615 (ATT)
(202) 213 (ATT Wireless)
(202) 213 (TracFone)
(202) 824 (The main number for Fox News’s Washington bureau is (202) 824-0001 and Rosen’s work line starts with these six digits.)
(202) 861 (Verizon) (Time uses this area code and exchange, but so do other unrelated entities.)
(202) 883 (Verizon)

http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/politics/anthony-weiner-mayoral-campaign/index.html|Disgraced ex-congressman Weiner says he's running for NYC mayor
From Alison Harding, CNN
updated 1:44 AM EDT, Wed May 22, 2013
(CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner is running for New York City mayor, he announced Wednesday morning in a video posted on his campaign website .
"Look, I've made some big mistakes and I know I've let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons," Weiner said in the video. "I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it for my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."
Weiner plotting a political comeback?
Now that Weiner is in the race, the Democrat will undoubtedly face questions from voters and fellow candidates about the 2011 scandal that eventually led to his resignation from Congress.
His political career was derailed after he was found sending lewd photos and messages to multiple women. At first he lied, claiming his Twitter was hacked, but he later admitted to the indiscretions and left the House of Representatives.

http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/21/a-mileage-tax-for-all-n-j-drivers-with-help-from-big-brother-it-could-happen/|Separated At Birth
UNION, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — It’s a controversial proposal: Paying for every mile you drive to cover road repairs.
While some say it’s necessary, others are saying it’s time to put the brakes on the idea, CBS 2’s Christine Sloan reported Tuesday.
It’s the one thing New Jersey can boast about – having the fourth-lowest gas tax in the nation . The money goes into the state’s transportation trust fund, paying for roads and bridges.
But what if you learned the fund is $14.3 billion in debt, and the gas tax just covers a yearly $991 million debt payment?
“The problem there is because previous administrations and legislatures raided the transportation trust fund to use that money in general funds,” said Sal Risalvato of the New Jersey Gasoline Convenience Automotive Association .
It’s what prompted the bill to repeal the gas tax and have residents pay for every mile they drive, so cars that don’t use gasoline or get better mileage pay for roads, too.
“How are you going to track that?” one driver wondered.
It turns out, with a GPS device. The concern was about big brother watching, so after opposition, the sponsor of the legislation this week amended the bill to only tax electric and compressed natural gas-powered car owners with a yearly $50 fee.
“They’re using the same roads everyone else is so they should pay the same tax,” said Susan Berowitz of Mountainside.
“Why should they be penalized for helping the environment?” added Danielle Morse of Union.
The Sierra Club agrees, with director Jeff Tittel saying, “We try to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars but now this is a disincentive.”
He said raise the gas tax. But with federal incentives to make fuel-efficient cars, Risalvato said there could be a mileage tax.
“Someday this could be the means,” Risalvato said.
Risalvato said some insurance companies are using mileage tracking devices and car manufacturers could build them into cars.
The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Jim Whelan told CBS 2 that while he is for fuel-efficient cars, $50 isn’t much money when you can afford to buy a car that cost more than $40,000. Hybrid cars are exempt in his bill. Two other states have vehicle mileage tax laws, Washington and Virginia.

CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson said on Tuesday that her personal and work computers have been "compromised" for over two years.
Attkisson told a local Philadelphia radio station that she has been working with investigators to discover the source of the activity.
"There has been an issue in my house and there has been an issue with my computers that's gone on for quite a long time that we're looking into," she said.
Attkisson has long been a thorn in the side of the White House, and a hero to conservatives, for her aggressive reporting on the incident in Benghazi and on the "Fast and Furious" controversy.
In 2011, she made waves when she claimed that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting on "Fast and Furious."
Host Chris Stigall asked if Attkisson thought that she had been the victim of a government operation, as the Associated Press and Fox News' James Rosen were . Attkisson was careful not to make any specific allegations about who had been targeting her, but she said it was possible there was a connection.
"I think there could be some relationship between these types of things and what happened to me," she said, adding that something suspicious had been happening since "at least February of 2011 and I think probably a significant period of time before that."
UPDATE: A spokesperson for CBS News told HuffPost's Michael Calderone, "We are investigating the matter."

We produce enough of oil not to have to import it from other places. If you look at the cost of gas in top oil﻿ producing countries in the world they only pay a small fraction for oil compared to us. Of course we consume a lot more than then they do but the reason we pay so much more is because a large portion of oil that we produce is exported to other countries. Does that make any sense to you? OIl companies take American oil, sell it to other countries for big profit and then charge us more.

10 Amazing Charts That Demonstrate The Slow, Agonizing Death Of The American Worker
By Michael, on May 16th, 2013
The middle class American worker is in danger of becoming an endangered species.  The politicians are not telling you the truth, and the mainstream media is certainly not telling you the truth, but the reality is that there is nothing but bad news on the horizon for workers in the United States.  In the old days, when the big corporations that dominate our society did well, that also meant good things for American workers since those corporations would need more of us to work for them.  But in the emerging one world economic system that our economy is being merged into, those corporations have other choices now.  For instance, the big corporations can now choose to limit the number of "expensive" American workers that they employ by shipping millions of jobs to the other side of the world .  And from their perspective, it makes perfect sense.  They can make much bigger profits by hiring people on the other side of the planet to work for them for less than a dollar an hour.  If they can get good production out of those people, then why should they hire Americans for ten to twenty times as much, plus have to give those Americans health insurance and other benefits?  Another major factor in the slow, agonizing death of the American worker is technology.  We live during a period when technology is advancing at a pace that is almost unimaginable at the same time that it is steadily becoming cheaper and cheaper.  That means that it is going to become easier and easier for companies to replace workers with robots and computers.  As I have written about previously , it is being projected that our economy will lose millions of jobs to technology in the coming years.  Yes, some of us will still be needed to help build the robots and the computers, but not all of us will.  And of course the overall general weakness of the economy is not helping matters either.  The American people inherited the greatest economic machine in the history of the world, and we have wrecked it.  Decades of very foolish decisions have resulted in the period of steady economic decline that we are experiencing now.
America is simply not the economic powerhouse that it once was.  Back in 2001, the U.S. economy accounted for 31.8 percent of global GDP.  By 2011, the U.S. economy only accounted for 21.6 percent of global GDP.  That is a collapse any way that you want to look at it.
Today, American workers are living in an economy that is rapidly declining, and their jobs are steadily being stolen by robots, computers and foreign workers that live in countries where it is legal to pay slave labor wages.  Politicians from both political parties refuse to do anything to stop the bleeding because they think that the status quo is working just great.
So don't expect things to get better any time soon.
The following are 10 amazing charts that demonstrate the slow, agonizing death of the American worker...
#1 Wages And Salaries As A Percentage Of GDP
As you can see, wages as a percentage of GDP are hovering near an all-time record low.  That means that American workers are bringing home a smaller share of the economic pie than ever before.
#2 Average Annual Hours Worked Per Employed Person In The United States
We are an economy that is rapidly trading good paying full-time jobs for low paying part-time jobs.  The decline in average annual hours worked that we have witnessed represents the equivalent of losing millions of jobs.  There has been an explosion of " the working poor " in the United States, and this trend is probably only going to accelerate in the years to come.
#3 Manufacturing Employment
As you can see, there are less Americans working in manufacturing today than there was in 1950 even though the population of the country has more than doubled since then.  The United States has lost more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities since 2001, and yet our politicians stand around and do nothing about it.
#4 Employment-Population Ratio
This is one of my favorite charts.  It shows that there has been absolutely no employment recovery at all since the end of the last recession.  The percentage of working age Americans that have a job has stayed under 59 percent for 44 months in a row.  How much worse will things get when the next major economic downturn strikes?
#5 Labor Force Participation Rate
This is how the Obama administration is getting the "unemployment rate" to magically go down.  They are pretending that millions upon millions of Americans simply do not want to work anymore.  As you will notice, the decline of the labor force participation rate has accelerated greatly since Barack Obama entered the White House.
#6 Duration Of Unemployment
The average amount of time that it takes an unemployed worker to find a new job has declined slightly, but it is still far above normal historical levels.  It is a crying shame that it takes the average unemployed worker two-thirds of a year to find a new job, but this is the new economic reality that we are all living in.
#7 Delinquency Rate On Residential Mortgages
Since there are not enough jobs for all of us, and since our wages are not rising as rapidly as the cost of living is, a whole bunch of us are falling behind on our mortgages.  As you can see, the mortgage delinquency rate has only dropped slightly and is still way, way above typical levels.
#8 New Homes Sold
American workers also don't have enough money to go out and buy new homes either.  Yes, new home sales have rebounded slightly this year, but we are nowhere near where we used to be.
#9 Consumer Credit
Millions of American families continue to resort to going into debt in a desperate attempt to make ends meet.  After a slight interruption during the last recession, consumer credit once again is growing at a frightening pace.
#10 Self-Employment At A Record Low
Since there aren't enough jobs for everyone, why aren't more Americans trying to start their own businesses?  Well, the reality of the matter is that the government has made it exceedingly difficult to start your own business today.  Taxes, rules, regulations and red tape are choking the life out of millions of small businesses in the United States.  As a result, the percentage of self-employed Americans is at a record low .
As all of these long-term trends continue, the middle class will continue to shrink, poverty in America will continue to explode and government dependence will continue to rise.
The numbers don't lie.  Today, the number of Americans on Social Security Disability now exceeds the entire population of Greece , and the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the entire population of Spain .
We are in the midst of a horrifying economic collapse, and the next major wave of that collapse is rapidly approaching.
Are you ready?

You’d probably be too weak from starvation to escape. Just kidding. I don’t know if it will get to the point where we’re taken to internment camps. I certainly hope it doesn’t get that bad. But it has happened in past. There is a book that everyone should read. It’s called “The Real Lincoln: A Second Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda and an Unnecessary War” by Tom DiLorenzo. Lincoln actually had political opponents imprisoned. The book was a real eye-opener for me in that what I was taught in the public school system was mostly fiction.
dancingontheheadofapin
Two more good books to read: “The Naked Capitalist,” by W. Cleon Skousen. (130 pages, a short commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley’s book  (1300 pages)”Tragedy and Hope. A History of The World In Our Time.”
The second book: “Fahrenheit 451″ by Ray Bradbury, another very short book.
Your mama
This is your main problem I think: way too much fiction
dancingontheheadofapin
I don’t have a problem, “Your Mama.” If you know how to read, I would advise you to get your head out of the sand and read not only the books I listed, but also George Orwell’s “1984″ and “Behold A Pale Horse” by William Cooper.  Cooper was murdered for exposing the government by writing and publishing this book.  Do a search for William Cooper or go to You Tube to see some of his videos.  The two books I listed in my previous comment are short books, so for those with a short attention span they will be fine.  If you want to really understand what is going on read the two in this comment.  Orwell’s book was thought of as fiction when it was written because no one believed it could happen.  Do  yourself a favor and get educated.

Believe not the written word of mankind. Reading is the reward for and your payment to the propagandist. Life is the only reality for the moment.  Let your neighbor’s lives be your evidence.
All information from the Government and all information from the
media is colored and changed for the benefit of the speaker and the
writer. Nothing we are told is real.
Judge by reality, not by hearing and not by reading.
dancingontheheadofapin
Read not the written word of mankind??  What about the Bible??  If we do not know history, we are doomed to repeat it.  Before written history was oral history, which was handed down from generation to generation. Some of the books of the Bible were written many years after Christ left this earth.  Those histories were passed down.  How would anyone know about anything beyond their own sphere of existence of the nation and the world unless there was communication?  Observation is subjective as is most communication.  Learn from it and then make decisions based on common sense.

All it takes is for OPEC to dump the dollar for something else(petro-dollars) and its Game Over. China could trigger that very easily and simply: just plain stop buying our debt. This would cause inflation to more than likely start rising at an uncontrolled rate(not quite Hyper, but close), which would cause OPEC to start looking at something else, and then our problems would multiply as the rest of the world would then start buying oil with some other form of currency and the dollars start flying back home. I actually hope this happens, the sooner the better, as  it would usher in a real recovery sooner instead of this miserable existence that we live in now….
Midwesterner
I mostly agree with you except China has already stopped buying our debt, that is why the FED stepped in to buy it, no one else wants it. As far as consequences of OPEC exiting from the US Petro Dollar, absolutely correct but Iraq and Libya tried that and we know what happened to them. Iran sells its oil for gold, not Dollars, which puts them on the radar too. As long as the most powerful military in the world is backing the Petro Dollar, they will be able to keep the game going.
MeMadMax
Incorrect, china is still buying debt, they have to unless/until the yen gets a good foothold. The segment that has stopped buying our debt is the personal type, as in individuals/small groups and the like. Although you would be correct in saying the Fed is buying the bulk of the debt however. And the opec deal all falls on saudi arabia, I think they will  pull the trigger after they get a nuke. They are actively shopping for one(and not hiding it), along with Bahrain.
Your mama
Really? You don’t think the bush gang has given their boyfriends in S.A. a few nukes by now?
MeMadMax
Nope. They would advertise the fact directly to Iran by now.
MeMadMax
Ugg, I mean Saudi Arabia will pull the plug on the dollar once they get their hands on a nuke AND a stronger currency takes hold. In that case, a nuke would be an insurance policy for doing whatever they want without worries of attack either from Iran the US or anyone.
http://www.facebook.com/gilbert.furguson Gilbert Furguson
they have several nukes thats why they did not receive scud missile attacks during gulf two
MeMadMax
mmm, no. Saddam lost most of his scuds during the first gulf war. There were hunter killer parties of Apache helicopters that destroyed most of them, hundreds of them… When gulf war 2 happened, patriot missile was on the scene and reliable, you also had the 5th fleet stationed 24/7/365…

Also, everyone would know that the Saudi’s have nukes, particularly Iran.

The facts are there no doubt. The charts are well done. Now how do you get 80% of the American public, to pull their heads out of the sand to read them. Also for those who agreed during the Cyruss crisis. That part of the game was the Russians wanted use of Cypress facilities for its’ new Mediterranean fleet. The first Russian task force docked in Cypress today. First time since USSR collapsed, that elements of the Russian pacific fleet have entered the Med.
Felicia
Contradiction. The increased number of women in the workforce quadrupled from the Rush Limbaugh era of the 1950s. A majority of middle class women are making more money than ever before in history, more women are in top position jobs and more women are enrolling in college.
The visible minorities are the marginalised groups, but affirmative action will increase the job prospects for the visible minorities in America.
Syrin
You’re kidding right?   You know WHY more women are in the work force?   Look at that graph showing wages.    They HAVE to be.   Affirmative Action is why we have the worst president in history occupying the WHite House.    Affirmative Action forces employers to hire unqualified people at above market salaries, and they can’t fire them because minorities are no longer protected classes, they are privileged.
Angela
That is racist. Diversity is our strength. Diversity is good. FYI, if it wasn’t for affirmative action, I would have been neglected for hiring. Because I am a girl, I face discrimination in the patriarchal society. Did you know that a woman earns 45% less than an average white man working the same job?
Syrin
Diversity is not good.   Multi-culturalism has proven to be a failed experiment leading to violence.
Read and learn.   Stop blaming men for your problems: “Generally, women value relationships more than their careers or money, enter and leave the work force at a much higher rate, work part-time at a much higher rate, and work in professions with much lower compensation. As he explains in his book,Why Men Earn More, nearly all of it boils down to differences in occupation, and men overwhelmingly dominate jobs that
are in an unpleasant environment (sanitation vs. child care)
require harder-to-attain skills (physics vs. philosophy)
require longer work hours
demand financial risk (entrepreneur vs. teaching)
are inconvenient (i.e., relocation)
are hazardous (construction vs. librarian)
Due to the simple laws of supply and demand, these occupations pay more and contribute immensely to the pay gap. But again, government statistics completely neglect occupation — making a raw comparison of all working men and women instead (e.g., the female receptionist is lumped in with the $21,000/hr Lebron James and little-guy Michael Moore).
Wage gap statistics also do not account for time commitment. On average, women work far less than men because they choose to have much more balance in their lives. A study by the Center for Policy Alternatives and Lifetime Television found that nearly 85 percent of women took advantage of flexible work arrangements offered by their employers. And a decade after graduating college, 39 percent of women leave the work force or work part-time, versus 3 percent of men. Aside from the obvious benefits of working longer, workers who average 44 or more hours per week earn approximately 100 percent more than workers who average 40 hours.”

Here’s an example of discrimination against a woman brought to you by the PC affirmative action police in Philadelphia. A trilingual college-educated Hispanic/Uruguayan woman I know applied for a job with the city, which was enthusiastic when they saw her Spanish name but quickly lost their enthusiasm when they saw  that she was a WHITE Hispanic woman. The idiot affirmative action Democraps couldn’t wrap their racist heads around the fact that a woman could be both white and Hispanic. She didn’t fit their narrow view of what a Hispanic woman is supposed to look like. So much for “diversity.”
Conclusion: some of the worst bigots are government Democraps who support affirmative action quotas.
https://www.facebook.com/beth.s.owens1?ref=tn_tnmn Beth
45%? Perhaps in some instances but not as a whole. Refresh your research. And you only face discrimination in a patriarchal society because you believe you do. Get rid of that chip on your shoulder; believe in yourself and remember the wise words of Eleanor Rossevelt–”No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”.

wow…where did all these new people come from? Felicia, Tracy, you sound like you had just plagiarized a Sociology textbook. I think you are missing the whole point of this article (as well as the stats) in that our jobs and productivity have been shipped offshore and we are simply living on a falsely inflated economy and borrowed time. “Affirmative Action” is just so much more politically correct mumbo jumbo that actually punishes companies and employers rather than helping the marginalized in attaining opportunity. The problem with so many ideas set forth by….well, idealists–is that they SOUND all good but in all reality we DON’T live in a Utopian world; MLK’s dream is great for inspiration but the reality of such dreams will always fall short.
Tracy, you post about the future of our next generations being in the hands of todays girls (loose quote, sorry) is a scary and sobering thought. So many young people are caught up in what I call the “Matrix”, an unreal technological world unattached from down to Earth reality; a narcissistic generation that cannot live without constant input, affirmation, attention, etc. from their peers. So many  young people have NO real life skills WHATSOEVER. How IS this next generation going to function? Are they going to go to college, get a government job (pretty soon it looks like all jobs are going to be government jobs) pay other people to cook, clean, and raise their children? Already happening. I am almost 50 years old, I’ve seen a lot and the world change so very much in my life; but I can assure you the best thing you can give to your children/the next generation is STABILITY. Not a $400 phone, not the best day care ever, not the best labels out there, but the stability, love and encouragement of parents/caretakers that are totally committed to the upbringing of their young.

I’m not exactly a feminist, but I’m not patriarchal either. No particular bias,  my POV comes from real life and observation. Stats are just horrible for children raised in fatherless homes.
When our kids were young, we chose to live SIMPLY in order to give to them stability.
Roseof13
The mental, spiritual and emotional health of future generations is directly related to the amount of time, care and input they enjoy from wise women who understand that a woman does not need to compete with a man and raising a family is the highest art.
Equal does not mean same. We are not the same, but we are equal in terms of honour we deserve for doing that which is our main purpose and mission.
A full time mother is a physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, healer, artist, spiritual leader, etc, etc..
Opportunities for further learning and sharing abound in a women’s realm.
What happens to the children who are being raised by the internet, TV and their peers?
Are we better off after this drive for women to prove their equality by competing in the realm of career?
Men need to honor and respect our realm and both men and women need to come together and learn (or re-learn) how to have peace in our homes.
Craig
Good point Roseof13…..The economy is going down, jobs are being lost by the tens of thousands and the only solution given from these radical feminists is they should get jobs :-/ Radical feminists are a bunch of whining, entitled and spoiled women who can’t find a decent man and when the thugs and dunces wear out their bodies, the feminists spew hatred all over the place like the stuff squirted on their face in the rave parties.
El Pollo de Oro
Craig: Tom Leykis has had a lot to say about the type of bitches you describe. When they’re still attractive, they waste their youth on every type of loser, reprobate and scumbag they can get their hands on (or as you put it, “thugs and dunces”). But when their youth and looks gone are gone and they are 50 or 60 pounds overweight (all that boozing, binge eating and cigarette smoking takes it toll), they want a decent, responsible guy to support them financially. They go from spreading their legs for drug addicts and sociopaths to saying that they won’t date any guy who makes under 100K (as if a guy who makes that kind of money wants to date a frumpy, obese bitch in sweatpants).

You do realize that white women are minorities as well right? See, you’re the racist because you actually blame black people for something that white people created in the first place. Affirmative action benefited white women more so than black women and men. Also, affirmative action did not cause Obama to be president. Interesting, Obama is half white (bi-racial) and yet, you call him black. You don’t claim his white side from his mother. Interesting racist you are. When I think of worst president, Ronald Regan qualify because he created the private prisons and expanded the “war on drugs”.

We are all of us, evil.
Eve was deceived but Adam disobedient.  Women can be saved from this stigma of leading the human race to sin and death, only through repentance in Christ,… and then even more hope for some of those sisters – rearing godly children in the Lord.
The fall came to mankind by Eve’s actions and so the Lord incarnates himself in the virgin Mary’s womb to make the ultimate sacrifice for sin – once and forever, but not for all sinners.
This incarnation of God to be the God Man, is Jesus, who came that he would destroy the works of the devil.
Sisters in the meetings of the saints are wearing head coverings  You don’t see the men complaining about that.
The man God created first then the woman, and she out from the man.  The woman was to help and be one with the man. Not the other way around.  The genders are different by design.  The order of creation is dripping with meaning.
In a godless society like ours, the culture wants to blur these distinctions in the name of worldly equality and pay.
Just remember – the female, the bible says, are more fragile and instructs Christian men to dwell with them in understanding.
Perfection is but a foretaste in this life but wait until His kingdom is manifested in all of it’s glory.

you’re actually bragging about women taking away other people’s jobs in an economic crisis? That is why I walk straight and don’t look at those feminist fundraisers on the street asking for money. I spit on Betty Friedan’s grave and I would spit on radical feminists like you.
America is losing jobs and families are being destabilised because of the economy.
Feminists can no longer contribute anything meaningful to society. It’s like society rewards the deviant people and punish the ambitious Americans who uphold family values. I don’t mean to sound sexist or homophobic but the inconvenient truth is that someone in the upper echelons of politics and business is trying to destroy the family unit.
Arguing with a feminist is like arguing about religion. It leads to nowhere and leaves a lot of bitterness.

Fast and Furious/Benghazi investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson: Something fishy’s been going on with my computers since early 2011
posted at 10:41 am on May 21, 2013 by Allahpundit
Via the Chris Stigall Show and WPHT in Philadelphia. Two weeks ago, this wouldn’t have been worth posting; Attkisson herself, I suspect, wouldn’t have mentioned it publicly. Even if she’s right about something fishy going on, there are other plausible culprits besides the U.S. government when it comes to reporters’ computers being infiltrated. Two weeks later, though, knowing now that the DOJ was willing to order a dragnet of AP reporters’ phone records and actually read James Rosen’s e-mails, there’s no way around the obvious suspicion. If the feds were willing to monitor Rosen and the AP in the name of cracking down on leakers, why wouldn’t they monitor the one reporter from non-Fox big media who’s done more digging on Fast and Furious and Benghazi than anyone else?
Attkisson told Laura Ingraham in October 2011 that a White House official had screamed and cursed at her for her reporting. The DOJ wasn’t happy either:
I’m certainly not the one to make the case for DOJ and White House about what I’m doing wrong. They will tell you that I’m the only reporter–as they told me–that is not reasonable. They say the Washington Post is reasonable, the LA Times is reasonable, the New York Times is reasonable, I’m the only one who thinks this is a story, and they think I’m unfair and biased by pursuing it.
Which government sources were aiding and abetting this “unreasonable” reporter? There was one obvious way to find out. Any comment, DOJ?
Here’s the clip. The full Stigall podcast can be found here . Obvious exit question: Whether Attkisson was monitored or not, it can’t be just the AP and Rosen whom the feds have snooped on in four years. How many other reporters?

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/21/1210824/-ObamaCare-Betrayal-Big-Corporations-To-Offer-Health-Insurance-NOT-Covering-Hospital-Stays-Surgery|128 Comments
If you work at Bill Miller Bar-B-Q in Texas, ObamaCare means that you'll get the following insurance plan. Oh, you lucky duckies! From the debacle that is putting preservation of private health insurance corporation profits ahead of public health:
San Antonio-based Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, a 4,200-worker chain, will replace its own mini-med with a new, skinny plan in July. The new plan... will cover only preventive services, six annual doctors' visits and generic drugs. X-rays and tests at a local urgent care chain will also be covered. It wouldn't cover surgeries or hospital stays.
You got that right -- thanks to immoral employers -- and gutless politicians and regulators -- big business will be able to offer the same 'shitty deals' to their employees that they have in the past without getting in any trouble:
Employers are increasingly recognizing they may be able to avoid certain penalties under the federal health law by offering very limited plans that can lack key benefits such as hospital coverage.
Benefits advisers and insurance brokers—bucking a commonly held expectation that the law would broadly enrich benefits—are pitching these low-benefit plans around the country. They cover minimal requirements such as preventive services, but often little more. Some of the plans wouldn't cover surgery, X-rays or prenatal care at all.
Federal officials say this type of plan, in concept, would appear to qualify as acceptable minimum coverage under the law, and let most employers avoid an across-the-workforce $2,000-per-worker penalty for firms that offer nothing.
The idea that such plans would be allowable under the law has emerged only recently. Some benefits advisers still feel they could face regulatory uncertainty. The law requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty. Many employers and benefits experts have understood the rules to require robust insurance, covering a list of "essential" benefits such as mental-health services and a high percentage of workers' overall costs.
Say what?! Employers are set to screw over employees by providing them with coverage that won't even help them pay the bill for a broken leg, and the Federal Government is agreeing with these bastards 'in concept'?
Fuck you, Max Baucus, and weak-kneed Health & Human Services bureaucrats:
But a close reading of the rules makes it clear that those mandates affect only plans sponsored by insurers that are sold to small businesses and individuals, federal officials confirm. That affects only about 30 million of the more than 160 million people with private insurance, including 19 million people covered by employers, according to a Citigroup Inc. C +0.20% report. Larger employers, generally with more than 50 workers, need cover only preventive services, without a lifetime or annual dollar-value limit, in order to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty.
Such policies would generally cost far less to provide than paying the penalty or providing more comprehensive benefits, say benefit-services firms.
Administration officials confirmed in interviews that the skinny plans, in concept, would be sufficient to avoid the across-the-workforce penalty. Several expressed surprise that employers would consider the approach.
Of course, our friends at Aetna and Cigna must be drooling over this travesty -- they make big bucks on junk insurance that covers nothing at all.
In short, from Physicians for a National Health Program :
Imagine health insurance not covering hospitalizations nor surgery. Yet this is still possible because the Affordable Care Act applies the essential health benefit requirement only to plans for small businesses and individuals and not to larger employers.
This has opened up the opportunity for a conspiracy between larger employers who could care less whether or not their employees have health insurance and private insurers who are quite willing to sell these almost worthless bare-bones products as long as there is a profitable market for them.
The solution is obvious. Cover all care that people need, and then provide that coverage to everyone, automatically. Maybe these uncaring employers might not like that, but when the taxes to pay for an equitable system are obligatory, they would get used to the idea of their employees being able to obtain health care when they need it. Not such a bad idea after all, especially when their competitors are treated the same.
Our health care non-system is fucking barbaric, cruel and insane.
SinglePayer (Medicare For All) is the only solution -- clearly, our private insurance and corporate overlords are unwilling to submit to the regulatory oversight necessary to make a 'market-based' Swiss system work in this country.

7 Things About The Mainstream Media That They Do Not Want You To Know
By Michael, on May 20th, 2013
Have you ever wondered who controls the mainstream media?  In America today, we are more "connected" than ever.  The average American watches 153 hours of television a month, and we also spend countless hours watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, reading books and surfing the Internet.  If someone could control the production of all of that media, that would make them immensely powerful.  They would literally be in a position to tell people what to think.  Well, what if I told you that there are just six enormous media conglomerates that combine to produce about 90 percent of all the media that Americans consume.  Would that alarm you?  It should alarm you.  The truth is that our attitudes, opinions and beliefs are greatly shaped by what we allow into our minds.  After all, they don't call it "programming" for no reason.  Even those of us that realize that we are connected to "the matrix" probably greatly underestimate the tremendous influence that the media has over us.  We live at a time when it is absolutely imperative to think for ourselves, but most Americans are being absolutely overwhelmed with information and seem more than content to let others do their thinking for them.  Sadly, this is greatly contributing to the downfall of our society.
And of course the mainstream media desperately does not want you to look at "the man behind the curtain".  They just want you to stay plugged into the "programming" that they are feeding you without asking any questions.
Fortunately, a growing minority of Americans are waking up and are starting to reject the mainstream media.  An increasing number of people are beginning to recognize that the mainstream media is the mouthpiece of the establishment and that it is promoting the agenda of the establishment.
So why is the mainstream media so bad?  The following are 7 things about the mainstream media that they do not want you to know...
#1 The Mainstream Media Has Very Deep Ties To The Establishment
Did you know that the president of CBS and the president of ABC both have brothers that are top officials in the Obama administration?
The big news networks have developed an almost incestuous relationship with the federal government in recent years.  But of course the same could be said of the relationship that the media has with the big corporations that own stock in their parent companies and that advertise on their networks.
This is one of the reasons why we very rarely ever see any hard hitting stories on the big networks anymore.  The flow of information through the corporate-dominated media is very tightly controlled, and there are a lot of gatekeepers that make sure that the "wrong stories" don't get put out to the public.  As a result, many of the "big stories" that have come out in recent years were originally broken by the alternative media.
#2 The Mainstream Media Gets Things Wrong Very Frequently
Even prominent members of the mainstream media admit that this is the case.  For example, during a recent speech at Quinnipiac University CBS anchor Scott Pelley confessed that journalists in the mainstream media " are getting big stories wrong, over and over again" ...
"Let me take the first arrow: During our coverage of Newtown, I sat on my set and I reported that Nancy Lanza was a teacher at the school. And that her son had attacked her classroom. It's a hell of a story, but it was dead wrong. Now, I was the managing editor, I made the decision to go ahead with that and I did, and that's what I said, and I was absolutely wrong. So let me just take the first arrow here."
#3 The American Public Does Not Consider The Media To Be Very Trustworthy
Trust in the mainstream media has definitely been slipping.  In fact, a Gallup poll taken last year found that distrust of the media had reached an all-time high .  According to that poll, 60 percent of Americans "have little or no trust" that the media is reporting the news accurately.
A separate Rasmussen Reports survey found that only 6 percent of all Americans consider the news media to be "very trustworthy".
Hopefully this trend will accelerate and a lot more people will stop trusting the media blindly.
#4 The Mainstream Media And The Politicians That They Worship Hate The Fact That They Cannot Control Internet News Sites
In the old days, the mainstream media had a virtual monopoly on the news.  But these days, anyone with an Internet connection can put up a news site, and this is driving the establishment absolutely bonkers.
For example, Barack Obama is known to have a great dislike for the alternative media.  The following is from a recent  WND article ...
NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd says President Obama was making it “clear” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner over the weekend how he feels about the rise of Internet news sites like Politico, Buzzfeed and … well, WND.
“He hates it.”
Appearing on “Meet the Press” Sunday morning following Saturday night’s media, politics and celebrity soiree, Todd explained the president’s disdain for independent online news sources was showing during his speech.
“It did seem … I thought his pot shots, joke-wise, and then the serious stuff about the Internet, the rise of the Internet media and social media and all that stuff – he hates it, OK? He hates this part of the media,” Todd said. “He really thinks that the, sort of, the buzzification – this isn’t just about Buzzfeed or Politico and all this stuff – he thinks that sort of coverage of political media has hurt political discourse. He hates it. And I think he was just trying to make that clear last night.”
#5 The Mainstream Media Is Extremely Liberal
When it comes to politics, the mainstream media is far more liberal than the general population is.
For example, one survey found that  41 percent of American voters believe that the average reporter is more liberal than they are, while only 18 percent believe that the average reporter is more conservative than they are.
A very disturbing UCLA study on media bias discovered that the vast majority of media outlets are "left of center"...
Of the 20 major media outlets studied, 18 scored left of center, with CBS’ “Evening News,” The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times ranking second, third and fourth most liberal behind the news pages of The Wall Street Journal.
And even MSNBC has confirmed the liberal bias of the media.  According to MSNBC , mainstream journalists are far more likely to donate their own money to Democrats than they are to Republicans...
MSNBC.com identified 143 journalists who made political contributions from 2004 through the start of the 2008 campaign, according to the public records of the Federal Election Commission. Most of the newsroom checkbooks leaned to the left: 125 journalists gave to Democrats and liberal causes. Only 16 gave to Republicans. Two gave to both parties.
#6 Six Mammoth Media Corporations Produce About 90 Percent Of The Media That Americans Consume
As I mentioned at the top of this article, there are six giant media behemoths that control almost all of the media that we consume.  These corporate giants own television networks, cable channels, movie studios, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, video game makers, music labels and even many of our favorite websites.
The media ownership chart posted below originally comes from a previous article that I authored entitled " Who Owns The Media? The 6 Monolithic Corporations That Control Almost Everything We Watch, Hear And Read ", but it has been updated to reflect some of the latest information.  The power that these companies have is so vast that it is hard to put into words...

#7 The American People Are Absolutely Addicted To The Mainstream Media
In a previous article about the media , I noted that the average American watches 153 hours of television a month.
When you allow that much information to be downloaded into your brain, it is going to have a dramatic impact on how you think.
Americans are more "connected" than they ever have been before.  This is especially true of our kids.  They are constantly on one sort of electronic device or another.  The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Daniel Taylor ...
According to a 2010 LA Times report , young people spend on average 53 hours a week watching TV, playing video games, and sitting at the computer.
Facebook users spend about 15 hours a month on the social networking site.
People are walking – and driving – blindly while texting, sometimes walking into fountains and even falling off cliffs.
If that Los Angeles Times report is true, that means that our young people are spending more than 200 hours a month connected to the media.
But we are only awake for about 480 hours a month.
When it comes to influencing the American people, nobody has more power than the big media companies do.
And until we can break this sick addiction to the mainstream media and get people to start thinking for themselves, we will never see widespread changes in our society.  As long as people are being "programmed" by the mainstream media, they will continue to express the opinions, attitudes and beliefs that have been downloaded into their minds.
Please share this article with as many people as you can.  It is crucial that we wake as many people up as possible while we still can.

Turning it off is the best thing any of us can do to fight back.  When your friends and family start talking about this or that on TV, say “sorry, we don’t watch TV” and check out the look on their faces.  We’ve been a Zero TV Home since 1998 and love that look.  And we don’t miss TV one tiny bit.

I don’t think many people here are quite grasping what you mean by “super rich”.  Very few Hollywood type celebrities are even close to super wealthy, they have just enough to shut them up and keep them entertaining the peasants.
Come to think of it I don’t think they get what you mean by liberal either.  Bill Gates and George Soros?  Super wealthy, yes, liberal, well I think that’s debatable.  It’s one thing to talk the talk and throw a little money to charity as a token gesture, it’s quite another to actually accept a downgrade in one’s own lifestyle in order to allow others a chance in the game of life.  Names like Rockefeller are what we’re really looking at when we talk about super rich, and I don’t think they have ever been accused of being liberal.

Ironically, Rush Bimbo is and has been a part of the problem.  Just like Pawn Hannity and others, they supported/defended GWB’s TYRANNY and then they talk against Obama’s TYRANNY, when in fact it all goes hand in hand!  That is their job, the PROSTITUTES in the media, to keep you all confused with the 2 party…1 party system.  You all believe their is one ounce of difference in the 2 parties???  Yes…you say.  Ahhh, the production based programming for theater is working just as it was designed to…for you SHEEPLE!
El Pollo de Oro
Ricky Ross; Very insightful post. Rush “Pillhead” Limbaugh (the OxyContin king), Bill-O The Clown and other neocons are propagandists for the Repuli-Con wing of the War Party, while MSNBC (also known as ONN, the Obama News Network) are propagandists for the Democrap wing of the War Party. But the American sheeple, to a large degree, are gullible tribalists. So they could care less how much “our guy” rapes and pillages as long as it is “our guy.” Faux News and MSNBC serve different wings of the War Party, but both serve the War Party.
“Barack Obama is so dangerous because he makes people that are traditionally anti-torture, anti-war, anti-police state just say, ‘Hey, I want NDAA. I want troops on the street. I want TSA sticking their hands down our pants. I want banker bailouts because it’s Obama.’  And strong conservatives went to sleep under Bush because hey, he’s a Republican.”—Alex Jones
“All the two parties are fighting for is who gets to
be the whore, the prostitute for the interest groups.”—Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
“I will not vote for the lesser of two evils. I will not support this criminality any
longer. I will not vote for the Gambinos or the Bonannos. I will not vote for the Republicans or the Democrats. To me, it’s a two-bit freak show.”—Gerald Celente
Lennie Pike
I agree. There will be outrage from Fox News, “conservative” radio, and the Republican Party – all a kabooki show for people who do not think for themselves. Control the fiat money scam and “they” control everything and everyone – almost

I honestly believe that Obama could be found–concrete and irrefutable evidence–to have ordered guns given to Mexican drug cartels, or given weapons to Al Quaeda in Libya which were used to kill Americans and destroy our embassy, or even joked about his use of the IRS to bully his political opponents–there could be evidence that he had his hand directly in all of these things and he would still be untouched……
OH, WAIT!!!….He actually was complicit in all of these events and the public and media responds with a yawn.
He could probably get caught like Marion Barry of DC with a crack pipe and hooker on tape and would still have tens of millions fawning at his feet………
Obama (like Oprah) is a cult………

I agree. In another article I wrote about this. I blame the feminist movement. They took the most important role in society and vilified it. Then, they convinced the women that they MUST join the slave/work force to be considered successful. Pitiful, but it worked just like it was supposed to. And now look at us.
Graham
Feminism also substantially increased the tax revenue that the IRS could collect.  They referred to it as the other 50%.
In a planned double whammy (see Rockefeller history), it also led to the breakup of the traditional family unit where kids were simply passed to the “State” for education.  The parents got bizzy elsewhere.
Other things have been strongly promoted since and it is being pushed everywhere left, right and centre.  The aim is moral and societal destruction at every conceivable level.
I will refrain from naming the specific group who are responsible for such outrageous mayhem.  They create war as well.
They also electronically create money in a similar fashion to yanking a rabbit out of a hat then charging the public for the pet food to keep all the rabbits alive.
Those in their 40′s/50′s/60′s plus must be going through a daily mind warp trying to figure it all out.

Children are born with a clean slate, pure, with no ideological hang-ups to dampen their wonder of the world around them.  It’s the parents and society that teaches them to be bigoted, and they mimic their parents bigotry because they adore them and want to please them.  Personally I think having two loving parents, regardless of gender, is worth a lot more to a child than having one or two dysfunctional ones.  But, sigh, homophobia is a great distraction from the real issues at hand, and it works wonders to divide communities.
Stezie
What stuns me the most is this: this week, Obama’s approval rating actually increased to 53%, despite the scandals going on. This just goes to show how apathetic most Americans have become. Even worse, this sends the message that Obama, and the Government as a whole, can pretty much do whatever they want at this point, since the public is unlikely to go after them. If this isn’t a bad sign, I don’t know what is.

assuming the 53% is real……..
damnadamzama
Yep, about as real as the unemployment numbers.
chilller
Wait…let me guess…you got that 53% number from….THE MEDIA! Just goes to show you that no matter how much someone dislikes or distrusts the MSM…for some reason they STILL believe some of the true garbage they pump out…53%…I don’t think so…IT’S THE MEDIA PEOPLE!
TX4Life
I don’t know.  Each day I become more convinced that people are getting dumber and dumber so it’s plausible to me that 53% of our population are stupid enough to approve.

Brainiac was a UK TV series that prove how quickly thermite could melt through a car engine block.
Funny, all the post 9/11 tests I saw of the substance being ignited in America made one think it can’t “cut” through steel.
I guess they were trying to rubbish many witness and scientific reports arising from Ground Zero.
Does anybody here still believe the attack was carried out by Muslims armed with box cutters that couldn’t competently fly a Cesna in FL?  Lets not go there!

Brainiac was also a continuing character in DC comic books in the 60′s and 70′s. He was a green skinned, super intelligent android that regularly crossed swords with Superman.  He had stolen an entire Kryptonian city before the planet was destroyed when it’s sun went nova, and kept it miniaturized in a bottle so that he could study the inhabitants.  Superman got wind of this and recovered Kandor after an epic battle with Bainiac.

You can forget making people “wake up”. America is the most TV saturated country on the planet. People can’t get enough of crap on TV. No one watches more TV in the world than Americans. I recommend the movie “Network” which predicted all of these things over 30 years ago.

The problem you speak of comes from a lack of cerebral coherence between the two hemispheres.  The vast majority of people are “left brain dominant”.
It is the “ego” which causes all the problems and when left unchecked, it becomes sociopathic, narcissistic and psychopathic in its nature.

yes, the mainstream media is our enemy. A wise person knows their enemy inside and out. Watching the national news is NOT a waste of time. I watch every night then go and find the truth by other means and measure the difference.
TX4Life
I love to compare and contrast the way the different news outlets portray situations.  They can certainly draw opposite conclusions among them.  They especially love to isolate one seemingly positive bit of economic news and try to convince the viewers that we’re in a real recovery. Never mind the other negative bits that continue to decline.
Graham
Yes… we are in a “recovery” and hopefully it will continue to blossom.
I refer to the many who appear to be rediscovering their own voice, sanity and consciousness (waking up).
Graham
Likewise.  I strongly believe all sides of the coin have to be observed in order to properly dissect and compartmentalise who is saying what and why.
As the MSM ratings continue to suffer, I note they refer often to the alternate media, usually trying to beat it down.  This will change after the recent “trilogy” of high profile “blunders”.
Even BritBoy Redcoat Pierce Morgan is changing his tune on the tyranny front.  Next week he will likely be pushing 3D printers or the new laser rifle.

The mainstream aka government controlled media is the tool by which we are heading like a speed train to secular totalitarianism and pervasive evil. The government and the media [except for Newscorp/Fox] is the means by which traditional America and our founding Judaio-Christian value system is evaporating. If the true facts of a story cannot be controlled, manipulated to fit the mainstream left wing secular outcome, it is ignored by all of the large media outlets. Remember how the lefty devils in the media ran with the phony rigged up Duke Lacrosse rape case until they could not push the lie any further ? There have been countless examples since 8+15+1969, where the mainstream liars contorted or ignored facts to fit their secular outcome.I used to sit and watch the evening news in the 70′s with my mother. I would ask her why the three networks would cover the same stories. She did not know then, but we all know now.  Recently, the murdering infanticide doctors Gosnell and the latest from Texas receive almost no coverage by the secular totalitarian left. Remember the liars on the left saying that legal abortion, aka murder, would prevent back alley abortions. MURDERING LIARS. Look at these death camps run by Planned Parenthood. The blaspemy by OB asking God to bless PP was outragious. Hundreds of thousands of Pro-Lifers assemble peacefully in Washington each year and this receives little to no coverage from the government controlled media. The crushing budget deficits and the national debt receives almost no coverage. Pres. Obama would not have been able to pass a security clearance for most government jobs and is our sitting President for two terms because the government controlled media decided to ignore his school records and much of his past. Mitt Romney, a good virtuous man, was run out of town by the demons on the left. The left wing media knows that Benghazi is 10 times worse than Watergate and will only give it slight coverage. The government controlled company line and outcome is that we will learn from it and we will move forward. The phony Watergate scandal was drilled into our heads for ten years. No Americans died because of Watergate but we fed four Americans to the wolves in Benghazi. American lives are wothless to these globalist totalitarians. Meanwhile, we have wire tapping and spying going on 24/7. When will America wake up ? When will America sober up and realize that this secularsocial experiment which metastasised on 8+15+1969 is a world wrecking failure. Shame on you Judas Catholics for what your have done. Christi Fidelis !

Not according to the data I’ve seen.  Have a closer look at his connections, dating back the odd decade or two.  South America is a good place to begin.

We pulled the plug on MSM and TV years ago. It became a source of disinformation and mind numbing garbage. Netflix isn’t that great either. Our kids do much better without an idiot box, boom box, Jack in the Box, or a boxed curriculum.

“#5 The Mainstream Media Is Extremely Liberal”
Well, that’s the nature of the news. The conservatives published the Thora, the Bible and the Quran, and then they refer to these books all the time.

Back in the day when the MSM was not a parrot to the shadow gubermint, one would hear news stories from different MSM outlets and they would never be identical like today. You could tell each news outlet was doing their own work and seeing things differently. Not today….and technology has nothing to do with it. It’s no secret the shadow gubermint is in bed with the media…more like the media’s masters and overseers. Always remember the 3 tools these miscreants have at their  disposal: Intimidation…Manipulation…Provocation. 99% of the time you can attribute at least 1 of these tools to their dirty deeds…it’s their finger print.

The inability of the elites to control anything led them to push mainstream media on the forefront with the false hope that by manipulating peoples perceptions and beliefs would convince everybody that they are in control when in reality they cannot drive their own car.
They really think that people can be totally programmed to believe that some super wealthy elite is pulling all the strings on this planet and everybody else should bow down to them.
Very funny. Our elites are becoming our clowns!

This administration is using the cheating wife technique. "Even if caught in the act, deny everything."
As long as they do that and have the support of the news media, they hope to hold out until the news media puts everyone back to sleep.

You're right on top of it. Petraeus was a four star general and the director of the CIA. I find it hard to believe there was something happening like this and he was totally out of the loop.
As the CIA director he probably had to accept the loss of life as the leader of the Agency. As a military man, it appears he abandoned the two brave seals. If he did know something and testified to it it would show that he still had military character. If he didn't know anything he was probably padding his pension as the CIA director. But as four star generals go, he might as well have got the stars as prizes from Cracker Jack

Ham and Petraeus: lions in the field and lambs in the hall, in an odd twist. I know I'm brave to volunteer them for risking their freedom by sharing classified info, but hell, I can't do it myself. I only know as much as Hillary and Obama.

(And then remove the Commanders that wanted to rush in help!)  Plus deliberately sending that Ambassador into that specific place and time and then the attack starts within one hour of time of his scheduled meeting.  Explain that behavior.  The best explanations I've seen is that the intent was to set up a kidnapping of the Ambassador for an exchange for the Egyptian Cleric we hold in jail (AND that Obama had tried earlier to send back to Egypt but Congress intervened).  The motive could have been to make Obama look strong in foreign relations just before the election.  I have no idea if that was true, but the explanations that the administration has provided DO NOT support what happened.
Only the explanation that the attack was expected and supported for "some" purpose provides the motive for the repeated denied extra security and repeated "Stand Down" orders given to do those that wanted and COULD HAVE provided aid.
Other explanations center around the likelihood of secret arms shipments being passed through Libya orchestrated by Ambassador Stevens.  But I don't think it explains the clear effort to deny security and aid.  Somebody wanted the bad guys at the gate to be successful in their intrusion.  My guess it wasn't supposed to kill anyone but the four Seals that returned to help (although having been told NOT to) provided a means to fight back and things soon got out of control.  Then the administration was in need of do some very fast track covering to avoid discovery.  The FBI wasn't even on site to do any investigating until a MONTH later.  And all the injured where kept away from the press.  And Hillary suddenly banged her head and avoided Congress.  Delay, delay.  Nothing to see here, move on.  And now,  of course, we hear from Hillary, "What Difference Does It Make??".  Clearly they hope that the answer is now that it doesn't..
Just the normal bumbling of the administration does not explain why they took such coordinated efforts to avoid providing aid.  There was NO real risk to the politicians in sending aid.  In fact, it was the LOW risk decision even if it was too late.   But it was actively denied.  Politicians would want to be seen as acting to help UNLESS something else more important to them was intended.
Note, that the whole IRS mess was deliberately released by the Gov itself!!  Just imagine that.  WHY would the IRS be told to tell a reporter to ask a specific question at a press conference just to be able to reveal what they've been up to.  We would not even have knowledge of what the IRS had been doing without having the culprits themselves revealing it!!!  (Plus it is a scandal that Obama is personally well isolated from while the Benghazi affair he ISN'T.)  Remember the best way to refocus an investigation is to start a bigger or more visible or more accessible fire somewhere else.
I'm not a conspiracy nut, but clearly this administration is fully capable of using false flags and false rescues if it served their political purposes.  These guys have NO moral compasses.  (Most politicians are capable of such.)
I suspect that if the truth does come out, Obama could be impeached.  But he has incredible powers to keep things suppressed, dodge the blame and pin the responsibility elsewhere.  I'm not overly confident that we'll know the truth while he is in office.  Maybe never.  But keeping such big secrets is very difficult especially after the culprit is no longer President and no longer has suppressive powers.
Don’t let up.  Keep digging.  Clearly there is something VERY, VERY, VALUABLE buried there.  They’ll take almost any scandal hit rather than let Benghazi be fully discovered.

More than a few people think it was a hit, that Stevens had to go. Whatever the true story, it is lethal, and it is why the other scandals emerged at the same time. They do not want this uncovered.

I've always thought the video was a loose end (among all the others). If they already knew it was a crock, how come it surfaced so conveniently? And how come the producer Noukala is still in prison? Something else stinks from that angle.

http://original.antiwar.com/vlahos/2013/05/21/antiwar-com-sues-fbi-after-secret-surveillance/|Share This
WASHINGTON – Antiwar.com is taking the FBI to court.
The website’s founder and managing editor Eric Garris, along with longtime editorial director Justin Raimondo, filed a lawsuit in federal court today, demanding the release of records they believe the FBI is keeping on them and the 17-year-old online magazine.
Antiwar.com says this is one more example of post-9/11 government overreach, and a stark reminder that the First Amendment has been treated as little more than a speed bump on the road to a government surveillance state. The lawsuit is particularly timely, considering recent scandals in which the Department of Justice secretly seized months of journalists’ phone records at the Associated Press, and did the same and more to a FOX News reporter , while the IRS is acknowledging it singled out conservative groups that criticize the government for extra scrutiny.
Suddenly, the press is more aware than ever that the state has the ability to secretly monitor its activities, heretofore thought of as constitutionally protected from government interference and intimidation.
“Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy, whether it’s AP or Antiwar.com,” said Julia Harumi Mass, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which is representing Antiwar.com in the case. “FBI surveillance of news organizations interferes with journalists’ ability to do their jobs as watchdogs that hold the government accountable.”
The suit was filed on Tuesday at the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. Both Garris and Raimondo live and work in the San Francisco Bay area.
According to the suit, the ACLU has made several futile attempts to obtain the FBI files since a reader alerted Garris and Raimondo to this lengthy FBI memo in 2011. The details in question begin at page 62 of the heavily redacted 94-page document. It’s clear from these documents, the suit alleges, that the FBI has files on Garris and Raimondo, and at one point the FBI agent writing the April 30, 2004 memo on Antiwar.com recommends further monitoring of the website in the form of opening a “preliminary investigation …to determine if [redaction] are engaging in, or have engaged in, activities which constitute a threat to national security.”
“On one hand it seemed almost funny that we would be considered a threat to national security, but it’s very scary, because what we are engaging in is free speech, and free speech by ordinary citizens and journalists is now being considered a threat to national security and they don’t have to prove it because the government has the ability to suppress information and not disclose any of their activities – as witnessed with what is going on now at the AP and other things,” said Garris.
“The government’s attitude is they want to know all, but they want the public to know as little as possible.”
In response, the ACLU began filing requests in December 2011 under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for any records the FBI was currently holding on Antiwar.com, which describes itself as a Libertarian-inspired project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. It was clear from reading the memo that Antiwar.com came under the radar in part for its mission, which is characterized as publishing a non-interventionist “online magazine and research tool designed to keep the American people and the world informed about the overseas plans of the American government.” [Full disclosure, this writer is a regular contributor].
While openly acknowledging that we have an agenda, the editors take seriously our purely journalistic mission, which is to get past the media filters and reveal the truth about America’s foreign policy. Citing a wide variety of sources without fear or favor, and presenting our own views in the regular columns of various contributors, we clearly differentiate between fact and opinion, and let our readers know which is which.
The website was also targeted, according to the FBI memo, for links it published to counter-terrorism watch lists (which were already in the public domain), and for the people who were visiting Antiwar.com and/or talking it up at rallies. The FBI noted at least two of Raimondo’s columns and wondered openly, “who are (Antiwar.com’s) contributors and what are the funds utilized for?” This, after acknowledging there was no evidence of any crime being plotted or committed.
“This illustrates the troubling, continuing efforts of the federal government to monitor protected speech activity without evidence or even allegation of criminal activity,” said Mass, who explained that there are specific prohibitions against such surveillance and record-keeping in the 1974 Privacy Act [5 U.S.C 552a(e)(7)] .
After Raimondo wrote about the FBI memo in August 2011 , which at the time, independent journalist Marcy Wheeler at EmptyWheel.net deemed a “troubling story,” Antiwar.com started losing donors, and according to the lawsuit, it was big time.
In October 2011, one of Antiwar.com’s major donors withdrew his financial support from Antiwar.com out of concern that the FBI would monitor him if he continued to provide, as he wished to do, financial support to Antiwar.com. Since then, three significant donors have also withdrawn financial support, citing their fear that FBI interest in Antiwar.com would lead to surveillance of the donors as a reason for withdrawing financial support. As a result, Antiwar.com has lost about $75,000 per year since 2011 in otherwise expected contributions.
Reached over the weekend, Wheeler, who routinely investigates and reports on the impact of post-9/11 government surveillance on civil liberties for EmptyWheel.net , voiced her concern about the apparent FBI surveillance of Antiwar.com and its far-reaching implications.
“It’s likely (the) FBI is hiding one or another things: Bush era investigations into the peace community that were improper to start with, and/or the degree to which First Amendment activities have become one reason to investigate completely innocent activity,” she said.
After a series of FOIA requests, amended requests and empty responses, Garris and Raimondo have “received no agency determination setting forth whether Defendant FBI intends to produce records or any basis for withholding them,” since the last request dated May 24, 2012. Taking it to court, Mass said, is the next step.
“Our clients are entitled to obtain records the FBI has gathered about them and their online magazine,” she said. “This is especially important because the FBI’s surveillance has impacted our clients’ ability to maintain support for their website and has impacted their editorial choices– exactly the type of harm the First Amendment is supposed to protect against.”
How it went down
The strange and unsettling story of Antiwar.com’s debut into the domestic War on Terror came in the summer of 2011, when a reader warned Garris and Raimondo that the website had been mentioned as a target of surveillance by the FBI in the batch of documents the reader said he obtained through a FOIA request and had subsequently posted on his blog.
The documents mostly concern a 2001 investigation of five Israeli nationals who were witnessed smiling and celebrating and taking pictures of the burning Twin Towers from a rooftop perch across the river from Manhattan in Union City, New Jersey, on 9/11. After witnesses called the police, the individuals, who all worked for a local moving company, were taken into custody and grilled by FBI and CIA for two months after it was deemed their work visas had expired, and there was a big wad of cash, box cutters and other items that raised red flags found in a search of their work van. Questions revolved around whether the Israelis were spies connected to the Israeli government, and whether they had foreknowledge of the tragic events.
The heavily redacted memo says the men were eventually deported back to Israel without charge, and the case closed. However, the FBI still had an interest in tracking evidence gleaned from the case and this is where Antiwar.com comes into the picture. Raimondo, in writing about the case of the five Israelis in 2002 , linked to an American-generated terror watchlist (which had been published elsewhere on the Internet) that went out to Italian financial institutions and it included the name of the man who owned the New Jersey moving company in question.
It is not clear whether this sparked further monitoring of Antiwar.com, or whether Antiwar.com was already in the FBI’s sights. Interestingly, the memo states that the information attached to the memo as supporting material (none of which was available, aside from copies of two of Raimondo’s articles), was obtained in part through a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) request.
The FBI said it also searched the Web, as well as Lexis-Nexis, the Universal Index (FBI central records), the agency’s Electronic Case File, Department of Motor Vehicles and Dunn & Bradsheet (credit reports) for information on Antiwar.com and for “one or more individuals” working for the website.
Some of the things that can be discerned from those searches and were noted in the FBI memo:
– That Raimondo had been writing about the five Israelis and in his columns linked to at least three different terror watch lists (all found in the public domain).
–That Antiwar.com was cited in an article, the name of the author redacted, about U.S aid to Israel.
– That an article that listed Antiwar.com as a reference was handed out in 2002 at a “peaceful protest” at a British air base in the U.K.
– That a member of a domestic neo-Nazi group had “discussed a website, Antiwar.com” while encouraging fellow members at a conference to “educate themselves” about the Middle East conflict.
– That a special agent’s review of hard drives seized during an investigation of an unnamed subject, revealed that the subject had visited Antiwar.com between July 25, 2002 and June 15, 2003, “among many other websites.”
“There are several unanswered questions regarding www.antiwar.com,” reads the FBI memo. “It describes itself as a non-profit group that survives on generous contributions from its readers. Who are these contributors and what are the funds used for?”
The memo goes on to say that “many individuals worldwide do view this website including individuals who are currently under investigation and [two lines redacted].”
The unidentified agent writing the memo concludes, “it is recommended that ECAU (Electronic Communications Analysis Unit) further monitor the postings on the website … it is recommended that a PI (preliminary investigation) is opened to determine if [line redacted] have engaged in, or are engaging in, activities which constitute a threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power.”
This is the decisive point of the memo as it pertains to Antiwar.com: that Garris and Raimondo and Antiwar.com, for writing about a particularly sensitive subject and for linking to information that is already circulating around the Internet, may be a “threat to national security on behalf of a foreign power,” and therefore subject to secret surveillance. That would make any journalist, who say, linked a story to documents published by Wikileaks, which is currently under federal investigation , suspect too, surmised the plaintiffs.
“This sort of government activity is so chilling because it puts the fear of government at a higher level, and among the news media,” said Garris, noting the negative effect that federal leak investigations are already having on the free press. “Once the people aren’t able to get information, the government can, potentially, have unlimited power.”
According to Mass, the ACLU is filing a separate, administrative request to the FBI to find and further expunge any files it may have on Garris and Raimondo.
“The government,” concluded Mass, “cannot keep records about people’s exercise of free speech unless it is related to a criminal investigation.”
Update: Antiwar.com contacted the FBI for a statement for this story. A press official there declined, saying the agency could not comment on pending litigation.

The Obama administration has gotten itself into a fix between its contradictory stories about the Benghazi incident, reports of the IRS targeting conservative groups, and the Justice Department’s grabbing of phone records from AP reporters. There are few things more fun to watch than arrogant political leaders -- folks who spend their lives bossing everyone around -- getting a comeuppance.

My favorite take wasn’t from any serious commentator but from comedian Jon Stewart, who noticed that the president routinely claims ignorance about embarrassing events by saying that he learned of them while watching the news: “I wouldn’t be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announcing it on television.”
I take a bipartisan approach to Washington, DC’s political scandals and find myself savoring them all, regardless of the party that is in control of the White House. Any sane person would conclude that all administrations and bureaucracies essentially are corrupt given that they thrive on the exertion of power of other people. We know about the corrupting influence of power, and DC has become like ancient Rome that way. It’s a magnet for those seeking favor, money, or a big title administering some pointless program.
I visited DC last week and was astounded at the booming economy, the endless new construction, the astronomical prices, and garish displays of wealth everywhere -- not to mention the haughty attitudes of every pissant assistant to the whatever. That’s what Other People’s Money buys you. When Ronald Reagan talked about the Shining City on the Hill he was speaking metaphorically about America, but the new shining city is DC -- funded on the backs of all those Americans who blithely vote for people who promise to solve their problems.
That’s the main lesson from this latest mess: the federal government is an untamable beast. These superficial scandals are nothing compared to the things we will never learn -- i.e., the way the CIA conducts its business overseas.
Still, there are so many things to savor as President Obama circles the drain. Obama has always exuded an intellectual arrogance. Yet if he’s so smart, why would his Justice Department target reporters? The national media has fawned over the president, but the quickest way to end that love affair is to go after their personal records.
Unfortunately, many people insist on seeing every scandal in terms of partisanship. Conservatives are aghast, as they should be, at the thought of an IRS auditing groups based on their political views. That is eerily totalitarian. But where would they have been had a Republican administration done the same thing to liberal critics? I doubt the activist groups would be sending out the alarmist direct-mail pieces if the latest Bush were still president.
The best news from the ongoing drama is that people on the left and right see problems here. Let’s use that as a foundation for a renewed civil-liberties coalition that understands that there are many bright red lines in which the government -- regardless of who nominally is at the head of it -- does not cross. That’s easier to do when one realizes that our supposedly limited government is so limitless in its size, power, and taxing ability that no president can control it.
When pundits complain about excess partisanship, what they usually are really saying is they are tired of all the political fighting. Yet political fighting is good -- it’s a sign of differences of opinion and assures that important issues get debated, however clumsily, in the public.
In Sacramento, California, the Republican Party has imploded and there is little worry about partisanship. But the state’s Democratic Party is now engaged in policies so secretive that even liberal-oriented pundits are getting concerned. No one has the power to say no, so the Democrats are ramming through every manner of dangerous bill.
The new health-exchange law shields most contracts under a veil of secrecy so that public money can be dispensed to friends and cronies without the public learning about where it is going. Democratic leaders have embraced a gut-and-amend frenzy -- proposing dozens of bills with placeholder language that will be stripped away at the last minute with new and completely different language inserted. This circumvents normal debate and oversight.
This is not a Democratic problem per se, but a government problem. And local governments are arguably even more dangerous to our liberties. In Bakersfield recently, after Kern County sheriff’s deputies beat to death a young father (after being called to the scene for a minor incident -- public drunkenness), they grabbed the cellphones of bystanders who were recording the incident. That’s right out of a police state.
Government is about power and force. Many people charged with power over others will abuse it. That’s human nature. Unfortunately, the nation’s founding ideals -- limited, accountable government, with separated powers and checks and balances -- have been fading away. Government is so big that even the president and the attorney general claim they have no idea what their departments are doing. I almost believe them.
We need to rebuild a coalition of civil libertarians of the left and right who agree to some basics, on some bright red lines that no government should cross. We need to provide a unified, bipartisan front on behalf of individual liberties and against any official from any party who would trample them. Maybe we can learn that constructive lesson from the administration’s unreconstructed behavior.

Tom Coburn, James Inhofe(Credit: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/AP/Sue Ogrocki)
Just a week ago, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe suggested that President Obama might be impeached over the Benghazi non-scandal. Now, Inhofe must watch as Obama declares Inhofe’s state a disaster area and promises Oklahomans “all the resources they need at their disposal.”
Inhofe, of course, believes his state deserves those resources, even though he voted down aid to Hurricane Sandy victims. On MSNBC, Chris Jansing confronted Inhofe about his calling the Sandy aid bill a “slush fund,” and the brazen right-winger insisted the two issues shouldn’t be linked.
“Let’s look at that, that was totally different,” Inhofe told Jansing. “They were getting things — for instance that was supposed to be in New Jersey, they had things in the Virgin Islands, they were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C.; everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma.”
Inhofe’s answer is too dishonest to fully parse. First of all, there was Sandy damage way beyond New Jersey, including in the Caribbean and in Washington, D.C., too. And Inhofe had different objections to the Sandy bill at the time. In a rambling, hard-to-follow Senate floor speech blocking Sandy aid last December, the Oklahoma conservative objected to the bill’s timing — “There’s always a lot of theater right before Christmas time … We shouldn’t be talking about it right before Christmas” — even though it was already going on two months since the storm ravaged the East Coast.
Inhofe was also exercised by the fact that the Sandy bill included what he said was $28 billion for future disasters. But the climate-change denier was particularly outraged that the bill included $3.5 billion to deal with what he called “global warming,” which led to a long rant against cap-and-trade legislation, and then his floor speech unraveled. (Interestingly, Inhofe’s own press operation put the incoherent speech up on YouTube , as though it was a proud moment for the senator.)
Oklahoma’s other GOP senator, Tom Coburn, brags that he’s going to seek tornado relief — but insist that the funding is “offset” by other cuts to the federal budget. Coburn is proud that he’s being consistent by placing the same conditions on disaster aid to his own state as he’s demanded elsewhere. Consistent, maybe — but also fundamentally cruel.
Especially in the wake of the sequester cuts, the notion that the federal budget is larded with easily eliminated spending is ludicrous. Would Coburn like to see more kids thrown out of Head Start? More seniors losing Meals on Wheels? The federal deficit is shrinking faster than at any time since just after World War II, but Coburn is going to insist that someone, somewhere, must lose their federal help so Oklahoma can get it instead.
There’s something so typical about today’s GOP in the way Inhofe can dismiss comparisons between tornado aid and Sandy aid while Coburn grandstands for his long-term demand that new spending, even on disaster relief, must be “offset” by cuts elsewhere. Meanwhile, the notion that a new disaster relief bill should include funding to cope with future disasters isn’t lauded as common sense, it’s derided as pork. Like Inhofe, Coburn objected to the Sandy bill’s including funding for future disaster relief. (It should be noted that Moore, Okla., Rep. Tom Cole, also a Republican, voted for the Sandy aid bill.)
Just as modern conservatism helped create categories of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor, we now apparently have deserving and undeserving disasters. When tragedy strikes, most Americans tend to want to pull together, but many Republicans look to pull us apart, placing their own constituents’ needs above everyone else’s.

E.W. Jackson, the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor, began his career as a minister and attorney in Boston. While there, he lent his support to a high-profile 1988 fight against a plan to desegregate public housing developments in the neighborhood of South Boston.
The 1988 battle over housing desegregation in South Boston began after the federal government found the city of Boston had illegally segregated public housing and prevented African Americans from moving into public developments in the neighborhood. Boston was ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to come up with a new tenant selection plan or face a federal takeover of its public housing system. As a result, Ray Flynn, the city’s mayor, came up with a desegregation plan.
Local news station WGBH filmed Jackson giving a speech at a July 1988 community meeting in South Boston hosted by opponents of the mayor’s desegregation plan. According to WGBH, at the event Jackson dismissed the desegregation plan as “social engineering.” In his remarks, Jackson characterized the matter as a question of freedom of choice.
“I am so tired of hearing the people of South Boston dumped on by the saviors of mankind that it makes me nauseous,” Jackson said of desegregation advocates. “I can understand the reaction of the people of South Boston apart from the racial issue because I don’t like being told by some bureaucrat how I’m going to live my life either.”
Jackson, who was identified as a radio station manager and pastor of the New Corner Baptist Church in Roxbury, also spoke with a reporter from WGBH. In the interview, he indicated he believed people should be allowed to choose to live separately from members of other races.
“I think that maximum emphasis needs to be put on the ability of people to choose, even if that means some housing developments are predominantly of one race or another,” said Jackson.
The reporter who interviewed him also asked Jackson, who is African-American, if he felt as though he was being “used” by white politicians who opposed the desegregation plan. His response made it clear he fully supported their efforts.
“Well, the scripture says it’s a good thing to be used in a good cause,” Jackson said.
According to the biography on his campaign website , Jackson first moved to Boston with his wife, Theodora, in 1971 as part of his service in the U.S. Marine Corps. He and his wife left the city in 1998, a decision that was partly motivated, by “their desire for an environment more compatible with their conservative and Christian values.”
Since he was nominated to run in the gubernatorial race alongside Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli over the weekend, Jackson has drawn widespread attention for his past comments criticizing gays . He accused President Barack Obama of harboring “Muslim sensibilities.” and A video he once filmed compared Planned Parenthood to the KKK.
Jackson and the Cuccinelli campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

By William Peacock, Esq. on March 20, 2013 11:50 AM
"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich." Sounds like two Guinnesses and something made out of chicken, doesn't it? It's making us hungry.
It's not food and drink, however. It's a complicated corporate tax loophole, exploited by tech companies and others with intellectual property, pioneered by Apple, and used by many to save billions of dollars in taxes.
It all begins with the licensing of patents and IP to an Irish subsidiary. When products are sold in the U.S., taxes are reduced by paying royalties to that subsidiary. Under Irish law, if the subsidiary is managed by foreigners, profits skip along, Irish tax-free, usually to a Caribbean tax haven.
When products are sold outside of the U.S., profits are directed to another Irish subsidiary, who forwards the profits to the Netherlands under a tax-free treaty, which kicks the profits back to the initial Irish subsidiary, which exploits the same foreign-manager tax loophole to send money to the Caribbean.
Confused yet? Here's a pretty diagram , courtesy of the New York Times.
(Apple's innovations go far beyond the iPhone, don't they?)
Your first question: Is this all legal? It better be, as a number of tech companies are doing it, including Amazon and Google , reports CNBC.
Then again, not all of them are succeeding. The problem comes down to the value of that intellectual property, or " transfer pricing ." How much is a patent worth? When a company is licensing patents to itself, it's going to be tempted to set the value to the amount that will best benefit itself tax-wise. (Higher valuation means larger business expense deduction.)
Instead, companies are supposed to determine prices at "arm's length", meaning whatever price would be appropriate if they weren't licensing to themselves.
Inappropriate transfer pricing does come back to haunt some companies. In December, the Internal Revenue Service went after Amazon for $234 million in back taxes , claiming over-valuation of IP. Of course, the IRS is not always successful. They famously lost a similar case against Veritas Software (now part of Symantec) in 2010.
With all of that said, should you advise your company to take the same route? The savings don't lie: One study estimates that Apple saved between $2.4 and $4.8 billion in taxes . Just be sure that your transfer pricing is reasonable. (And if you aren't a tax lawyer, it's time to consult outside counsel.)

The landmark legislation easily passed the Judiciary Committee, giving reform its best chance in six years on the Senate floor. Yet even if the bill clears the Senate, the GOP-controlled House isn’t likely to take it up in its current form.
( PHOTOS: At a glance: The Senate immigration deal )
The vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments. But the Gang of Eight, which drafted the legislation, held together and fended off all but minor changes to the bill.
“This is a big step forward,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a leader of the Gang. “We got a good vote in committee, we expanded our little group to another vote, and the feeling is very strong here. I think we gained some momentum today. I really do.”
Schumer and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters that they remained hopeful that the bill could pick up 70 votes on the Senate floor.
“I think it’s possible,” said Flake, another Gang member. “We got a lot of hard work to do. A lot of hard work.”
The committee room, which was packed with reform proponents, erupted in applause and cheers of “Yes, we can” after the final vote. Democratic senators posed for pictures with supporters and received a succession of high fives and hugs.
President Barack Obama issued a statement congratulating the committee and urging the Senate to take up the bill “at the earliest possible opportunity.”
( Also on POLITICO: House immigration talks hang on health care )
“The process for considering this legislation has been open and inclusive with multiple hearings, and more than a hundred amendments were considered and adopted, in many cases with bipartisan support,” Obama said. “None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I , but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.”
Senate leaders hope to begin considering the bill following the Memorial Day recess in June. That prospect got a boost on Tuesday when Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would not block debate from starting on the floor.
House leaders want their members to put forward their own version of immigration reform, which will be more conservative than the Senate bill. A bipartisan group of House negotiators announced an agreement last week on reform principles, but the lawmakers are struggling to finalize the deal.

http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-predictable-failure-of-fiscal-austerity-by-robert-skidelsky|Austere Illusions
LONDON – The doctrine of imposing present pain for future benefit has a long history – stretching all the way back to Adam Smith and his praise of “parsimony.” It is particularly vociferous in “hard times.” In 1930, US President Herbert Hoover was advised by his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system...People will...live a more moral life...and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.”
To “liquidationists” of Mellon’s ilk, the pre-2008 economy was full of cancerous growths – in banking, in housing, in equities – which need to be cut out before health can be restored. Their position is clear: the state is a parasite, sucking the lifeblood of free enterprise. Economies gravitate naturally to a full-employment equilibrium, and, after a shock, do so fairly quickly if not impeded by misguided government action. This is why they are fierce opponents of Keynesian interventionism.
Keynes’s heresy was to deny that there are any such natural forces, at least in the short term. This was the point of his famous remark, “In the long run we are all dead.” Economies, Keynes believed, can become stuck in prolonged periods of “under-employment equilibrium”; in such cases, an external stimulus of some kind is needed to jolt them back to higher employment.
Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time. To believe otherwise is to commit the “fallacy of composition.” What is true of the parts is not true of the whole. If all of Europe is cutting, the United Kingdom cannot grow; if the entire world is cutting, global growth will stop.
In these circumstances, austerity is exactly the opposite of what is needed. A government cannot liquidate its deficit if the source of its revenues, the national income, is diminishing. It is deficit reduction, not debt, that is profligate, because it implies wastage of available human and physical capital, quite apart from the resulting misery.
Austerity’s advocates rely on one – and only one – argument: If fiscal contraction is part of a credible “consolidation” program aimed at permanently reducing the share of government in GDP, business expectations will be so encouraged by the prospect of lower taxes and higher profits that the resulting economic expansion will more than offset the contraction in demand caused by cuts in public spending. The economist Paul Krugman calls this the “confidence fairy.”
The pro-austerity argument is pure assertion, but it is meant to be a testable assertion, so econometricians have been busy trying to prove that the less the government spends, the faster the economy will grow. Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
Economists arrived at some striking correlations. For example , “an increase in government size by ten percentage points is associated with a 0.5-1% lower annual growth rate.” In April 2010, the leader of this school, Harvard University’s Alberto Alesina, assured European finance ministers that “even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run.”
But two fallacies vitiated the “proofs” offered by Alesina and others. First, because the cuts had to be “credible” – that is, large and decisive – the continuing absence of growth could be blamed on the insufficiency of the cuts. Thus, Europe’s failure to recover “immediately” has been due to a lack of austerity, even though public-sector retrenchment has been unprecedented.
Second, the researchers committed the arch-statistical mistake of confusing correlation with causation. If you find a correlation between deficit reduction and growth, the reduction could be causing the growth or vice versa. (Or both the deficit reduction and the growth could be due to something else – devaluation or higher exports, for example.)
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end. Going through the same material as Alesina had, its authors pointed out that “while it is plausible to conjecture that confidence effects have been at play in our sample of consolidations, during downturns they do not seem to have ever been strong enough to make the consolidations expansionary.” Fiscal contraction is contractionary, period.
An even more spectacular example of a statistical error and sleight of hand is the widely cited claim of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that countries’ growth slows sharply if their debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90%. This finding reflected the massive overweighting of one country in their sample, and there was the same confusion between correlation and causation seen in Alesina’s work: high debt levels may cause a lack of growth, or a lack of growth may cause high debt levels.
On this foundation of zombie economics and slipshod research rests the case for austerity. In fact, the austerity boosters in the UK and Europe frequently cited the Alesina and Reinhart/Rogoff findings.
The results of austerity have been what any Keynesian would have expected: hardly any growth in the UK and the eurozone in the last two and a half years, and huge declines in some countries; little reduction in public deficits, despite large spending cuts; and higher national debts.
Two other consequences of austerity are less appreciated. First, prolonged unemployment destroys not just current but also potential output by eroding the “human capital” of the unemployed. Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
So we will remain in a state of “under-employment equilibrium” until policy in the UK and the eurozone is changed (and assuming that policy in the US does not become worse). In the face of clamor from the right to cut even more savagely, statesmen who are too timid to increase public spending would be wise to ignore their advice.

Security Trumps Justice in Upcoming Manning Trial
As the pretrial concludes, 'Aiding the Enemy' charge stands while prosecutors drop 'Reykjavik-13'
- Lauren McCauley, staff writer
Tuesday marked the final day in pretrial hearings in the court martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning. (Credit: Reuters)Prosecutors will proceed with the charge that Pfc. Bradley Manning "aided the enemy" when the trial of the alleged whistleblower commences next week.
Tuesday marked the final day of pretrial hearings in the court martial of Manning during which attorneys for both sides and Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over the trial, issued a series of revisions for the upcoming trial.
During the hearing, Manning accepted as a "stipulation of fact" that the government has evidence that Osama Bin Laden had taken a "close personal interest" in the WikiLeaks materials. This "fact" was illustrated through a series of letters between Bin Laden and a member of al-Qaida—one of which included the Afghanistan "war logs" that were among the WikiLeaks disclosures.
Further, Lind issued a ruling Tuesday that the prosecution could use classified documents "within limits" to attempt to prove that the material Manning transmitted to WikiLeaks was potentially damaging to US interests.
The issue on how best to handle classified information throughout the trial has spurred some debate and prompted a " dry run " session after which Lind concluded it was "not possible to elicit coherently nuanced" testimony on classified information in open court and thus decided to close portions of the trial, independent blogger Kevin Gosztola reports.
"The over-riding interest in protecting national security over-rides the risk of miscarriage of justice," said Lind, who also added that it over-rode Manning's First Amendment rights.
Most notably, during Tuesday's proceedings military lawyers announced they were dropping one of the charges against him and would no longer seek to prove the US soldier was guilty of leaking the state department cable, known as "Reykjavik-13," which reportedly demonstrates the US's "bullying tactics against Iceland to accept austerity measures in the wake of the global financial meltdown."
The Guardian's Ed Pilkington reports:
[Manning] has pleaded guilty to a lesser offence relating to the leak of Reykjavik-13 and liable to a maximum of two years. The US government had sought to press further statutory charges on him that would have added up to an additional eight years on his sentence, but has now dropped the count.
However, the change may be "limited in significance," Pilkington adds, in light of the more serious accusation of "aiding the enemy." If Manning is found guilty of "assisting Osama bin Laden by making public information that could injure the US," he faces a potential life sentence with no chance of parole.
Pilkington continues: 
Should Manning be found not guilty to having aided the enemy, he still faces a further 20 counts carrying an overall maximum sentence of more than 150 years. At a minimum, the soldier has already pleaded guilty to lesser charges, of prejudicing the good order and discipline of the military by leaking information, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
The trial, which begins on June 3, will be the most high-profile prosecution by the Obama administration of a leak of state secrets. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has authorized more prosecutions of whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined.

Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports .
Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. "She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course," the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times .
Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would "have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."
The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question .
Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.
Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name "tea party" or "patriot."
According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration , Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.
Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave "false or misleading information" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.
"The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner's lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions," Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. "Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow's hearing -- the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs."

"If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way.

"The admission by the Obama administration that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political opponents echoes some of the most shameful abuses of government power in 20th-century American history.  Today, we are left with serious questions: who is ultimately responsible for this travesty?  What actions will the Obama administration take to hold them accountable?  And have other federal agencies used government powers to attack Americans for partisan reasons?  House Republicans have made oversight of federal agencies a top priority on behalf of the American people, and I applaud the work that members such as Charles Boustany, Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan have done to bring this issue to light. I also strongly support Sen. McConnell’s call for a transparent, government-wide review to ensure similar practices are not happening elsewhere in the federal bureaucracy," Boehner said in a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-statement-irs-targeting-conservative-groups" target="_blank">statement</a>.

http://truth-out.org/news/item/16494-pbs-killed-wisconsin-uprising-documentary-citizen-koch-to-appease-koch-brothers|PBS Killed Wisconsin Uprising Documentary "Citizen Koch" To Appease Koch Brothers
Tuesday, 21 May 2013 09:19 By Brendan Fischer , PRWatch | Report

(Photo: Elsewhere Films)"Citizen Koch," a documentary about money in politics focused on the Wisconsin uprising, was shunned by PBS for fear of offending billionaire industrialist David Koch, who has given $23 million to public television, according to  Jane Mayer of the  New Yorker . The dispute highlights the increasing role of private money in "public" television and raises even further concerns about the Kochs potentially purchasing eight major daily newspapers.
The film from Academy Award-nominated filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin documents how the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision helped pave the way for secret political spending by players like the Kochs,  who contributed directly and indirectly  to the election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in 2010 and  came to his aid again  when the battle broke out over his effort to limit collective bargaining. 
Originally slated to appear on PBS stations nationwide as part of the "Independent Lens" series, "Citizen Koch" had its funding pulled after David Koch was offended by another PBS documentary critical of the billionaire industrialists.
"People like the Kochs have worked for decades to undermine public funding for institutions like PBS," Deal told the Center for Media and Democracy. "When public dollars dry up, private dollars come in to make up for the shortfall."
And that private funding can conflict with PBS' "public" mission and its editorial integrity. The PBS distributor "backed out of the partnership because they came to fear the reaction our film would provoke," Deal and Lessin said in a statement. "David Koch, whose political activities are featured in the film, happens to be a public-television funder and a trustee of both [New York PBS member station] WNET and [Boston member station] WGBH. This wasn’t a failed negotiation or a divergence of visions; it was censorship, pure and simple.”
"Park Avenue" Documentary Raised Koch Hackles
In November of last year, the New York PBS affiliate WNET aired a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney, "Park Avenue," that explored growing income inequality by contrasting the lives of residents in a luxury apartment building in Manhattan with individuals living on the other end of Park Avenue, in the Bronx. The film focuses on one of the apartment's wealthiest residents, David Koch, and does not paint a particularly positive image of the billionaire industrialist and his brother, Charles.
Koch is also a board trustee and major donor to WNET. And WNET's president called him before the documentary aired to alert Koch to the critical content -- and took the nearly unprecedented step of airing a disclaimer from Koch following the film calling it "disappointing and divisive." WNET also replaced the original introduction to the film, which had been narrated by actor Stanley Tucci, with one calling the film "controversial" and "provocative." 
“They tried to undercut the credibility of the film, and I had no opportunity to defend it,” the film's director Gibney told Mayer. "Why is WNET offering Mr. Koch special favors?"
Independent Television Service (ITVS), an arm of PBS that funds and distributes independent films, had funded "Park Avenue," and aired it as part of ITVS' popular "Independent Lens" series that runs on dozens of PBS member stations. ITVS also funded "Citizen Koch" and it was also slated to be aired on the Independent Lens series. 
But "Citizen Koch" got caught in the blowback.
Fearing Koch Backlash, Funding Pulled on "Citizen Koch"
ITVS was excited about the "Citizen Koch" documentary before "Park Avenue" aired. In April 2012, the company informed Deal and Lessin their film would receive $150,000, and that “Everyone here at ITVS looks forward to working with you on your very exciting and promising program.”
But once "Park Avenue" aired, WNET blamed ITVS for impacting its relationship with David Koch and not providing advance notice of the film's contents. Mayer writes: 
"[WNET President Neal] Shapiro acknowledged that, in his conversations with ITVS officials about 'Park Avenue,' he was so livid that he threatened not to carry its films in the future. The New York metropolitan area is the largest audience for public television, so the threat posed a potentially mortal blow to ITVS."
ITVS got the message, and quickly changed its tune on "Citizen Koch."
Lessin and Deal began receiving pressure from ITVS executives to change the title and de-emphasize the Kochs' political influence. One executive told the filmmakers the title was "extremely problematic" and that “we live in a world where we have to be aware that people with power have power.”
On a conference call in January, ITVS executives acknowledged the push-back from WNET over the "Park Avenue" film, and again urged the filmmakers to change the storyline. Sources told Mayer that what their message was "Get rid of the Koch story line ... Because of the whole thing with the Koch brothers, ITVS knew WNET would never air it."
"It is always a struggle for documentaries to get out there," Deal told CMD. "That's why PBS and ITVS are so important: they support independent filmmakers to say new things on the public airwaves." But because of funding pressures, "we won't have access to that audience now," he said. "We're disappointed."
PBS Reaction to "Citizen Koch" Proved the Film's Point: Money Talks
"Citizen Koch," which premiered at Sundance in January and competed for Best Documentary, followed the activism and struggles of former Republicans who felt betrayed by Walker's union-busting move (which he never mentioned on the campaign trail). The film documents the role of Koch-funded entities like Americans for Prosperity, which spent  $10 million  aiding Walker in his recall election. The film's final scene shows an Americans for Prosperity official making the incredible claim the group is "just like the Red Cross, just like any other nonprofit.”
In April of this year, one day after the film had its Dairy State premiere at the Wisconsin Film Festival, ITVS informed Lessin and Deal it had "decided not to move forward with the project."
In a statement, the filmmakers said this is an ironic turn: “It’s the very thing our film is about—public servants bowing to pressures, direct or indirect, from high-dollar donors.”
"I don't believe there was a concerted conspiracy to keep 'Citizen Koch' off of public television, with David Koch as a ringleader," Deal told CMD. "Instead, Koch's presence and role in that world created an environment that was hostile to our message. And that was enough." 
Just before Mayer's New Yorker article was published, on May 16, David Koch resigned from WNET's board. The resignation was the result, a source told Mayer, "of his unwillingness to back a media organization that had so unsparingly covered its sponsor."
As has been widely reported , the Kochs are now considering a purchase of eight major daily newspapers currently owned by the Tribune Companies. And that has Deal worried. 
"For anybody who says the owner or funder of an outlet doesn't have an impact on what gets published, I hope they'll think again."

http://www.realfarmacy.com/monsanto-found-guilty-of-chemical-poisoning-in-landmark-case1/|Comments
A French farmer who can no longer perform his routine farming duties because of permanent pesticide injuries has had his day in court, literally, and the perpetrator of his injuries found guilty of chemical poisoning. The French court in Lyon ruled that Monsanto’s Lasso weedkiller formula, which contains the active ingredient alachlor, caused Paul Francois to develop lifelong neurological damage that manifests as persistent memory loss, headaches, and stuttering during speech.
Reports indicate that the 47-year-old farmer sued Monsanto back in 2004 after inhaling the Lasso product while cleaning his sprayer tank equipment. Not long after, Francois began experiencing lasting symptoms that prevented him from working, which he says were directly linked to exposure to the chemical. Since Lasso’s packaging did not bear adequate warnings about the dangers of exposure, Francois alleged at the time that Monsanto was essentially negligent in providing adequate protection for its customers.
To the surprise of many, the French court agreed with the claims and evidence presented before it, declaring earlier this year that “Monsanto is responsible for Paul Francois’ suffering after he inhaled the Lasso product … and must entirely compensate him.” The court is said to be seeking expert opinion on how to gauge Francois’ losses in order to determine precisely how much Monsanto will be required to compensate him in the case.
“It is a historic decision in so far as it is the first time that a (pesticide) maker is found guilty of such a poisoning,” said Francois Lafforgue, Paul Francois’ lawyer, to Reuters earlier in the year.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to alachlor can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, spleen, and eyes, and may lead to the development of anemia and even cancer. The EPA apparently views alachlor as so dangerous, in fact, that the agency has set the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG) for alachlor to zero in order to “prevent potential health problems.” ( http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/alachlor.cfm )
In 2007, France officially banned Lasso from use in the country in accordance with a European Union (EU) directive enacted in 2006 prohibiting the chemical from further use on crops in any member countries. But despite all the evidence proving that alachlor can disrupt hormonal balance, induce reproductive or developmental problems, and cause cancer, the chemical is still being used on conventional crops throughout the U.S. to this very day. ( http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_ChemReg.jsp?Rec_Id=PC35160 )
“I am alive today, but part of the farming population is going to be sacrificed and is going to die because of (alachlor),” added Francois to Reuters.

http://www.laramieboomerang.com/articles/2013/05/15/news/doc519303f6ba00d303141049.txt|Next court date set in UW Crushes case
By JOSHUA ROBERTS / joshr@laramieboomerang.com  Wednesday, May 15, 2013
Share
A Laramie woman’s appearance Monday morning in Albany County Circuit Court didn’t take place as previously scheduled.
Meg Lanker-Simons, cited for interfering with a peace officer in connection with a social media controversy last month, is next set for a scheduling conference at 8:30 a.m. June 13 in Circuit Court.
Her attorney, Charles Pelkey, entered an appearance on her behalf and a not guilty plea in late April to the misdemeanor charge.
The charge stems from a UW Police investigation into a graphic, sexually-threatening comment posted on the Facebook page, UW Crushes.
Lanker-Simons was allegedly targeted in the comment. However, UW Police allege Lanker-Simons authored the comment.
“Subject admitted to making a controversial post on UW Crushes webpage and then lied about not doing it,” according to the citation.
The interference charge isn’t Lanker-Simons’ first experience with the local court system.
Documents outline radio station incident
According to court records, she was charged in November 2005 in District Court with aggravated assault. 
Lanker-Simons, then Meghan Michelena, pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2006 as part of a plea agreement, records indicate.
According to an affidavit, the charge stemmed from an incident in which Lanker-Simons walked into an Albany County radio station she’d been fired from with a Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun.
She confronted a man who had decided to terminate her, the affidavit reports. The man also told her, the court documents state, that she would not be rehired.
Lanker-Simons “pulled a semi-automatic pistol from her purse, waved the firearm around and pointed (the) firearm at (the man),” according to the affidavit.
The man, according to the affidavit, said he was “in fear for his life.” 
The radio station, the affidavit states, was evacuated.
Albany County Sheriff’s Office deputies made contact with Lanker-Simons as she was attempting to leave the area in her vehicle and detained her at gunpoint.
During an interview with deputies, Lanker-Simons “admitted to having (a) gun in (her) purse and pulling it out and waving it around (the) victim,” according to the affidavit.
She was sentenced to six years of probation in July 2006. 
The probation sentence was subject to numerous stipulations, including refraining from owning firearms, undergoing counseling, paying fines and fees, completing community service and submitting letters of apology to victims.
Later in 2006, she pleaded no contest to an attempt to revoke her probation. 
Court documents state she violated probation by being “unsuccessfully discharged” from a residential treatment program.
In April 2007, she was again sentenced to probation with the stipulation she complete a treatment program in Utah.
Web page removed
Last week, an online page at www.wepay.com seeking donations for Lanker-Simons’ medical expenses was removed.
On the page, she wrote she was seeking “donations because emergency surgery to remove an appendix time bomb has left our budget stretched beyond the breaking point,” according to a narrative explaining the monetary request.
“We’re finding it impossible to cover medical bills, pay rent and utilities, buy groceries and though I’ve been looking for full-time work, it’s been difficult to find anyone who’s even hiring. My husband and I are both working and going to school, but it’s just not enough.”
Since she was cited in the UW Crushes controversy, Lanker-Simons has referred questions to her attorney.
Pelkey said the wepay.com request was posted in February and gained recent attention because of a right-wing blog.
“Certainly this case has gotten a lot of attention, and there are a lot of people with a lot of opinions on both sides,” he said last week. “And, I would imagine there are people out there who believe Ms. Lanker did what she’s accused of doing and disagree with her politics.
“The assertion is she’s using it to raise money for her defense fund and fraudulently claiming that she needs a procedure. She did need the medical procedure, she got the medical procedure (and) she used funds because she’s a low-income person and got assistance.”
The wepay.com page had raised at least $2,400 before it was taken down.
Pelkey said his client has a full accounting of the donations and receipts for her medical expenses.
“We’re all in the position of having major expenses, really, for a major medical condition and she came up with a unique way of raising funds for it,” he said.
“Basically, her life has always been an open book online.”
Lanker-Simons, according to UW, participated Saturday in the College of Arts and Sciences’ commencement ceremony. 
She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Police Tase Foreclosed Upon Homeowners Protesting Criminal Bankers, Criminal Bankers Continue Facing No Repercussions
Why shoot peaceful protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant?
Taser International's X2 two-shot Taser for law enforcement is displayed in January. The US Supreme Court refused to review the use of Taser stun guns by police on two women, including one who was seven months pregnant at the time.
May 21, 2013  |  
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
 
You may have heard about the protests at the DOJ by foreclosed upon homeowners demanding that Eric Holder prosecute some bankers for their criminal activity. If you haven't,  you can read all about it here.  
Unfortunately, I received reports last night that citizens exercising their right to peacefully protest were being casually tasered by the authorities. 
This came from my friend Jason Rosenbaum, who was there:
At the start of the action, when the protesters and homeowners arrived at the south entrance of the DOJ, we were greeted by half a dozen police in tactical gear or uniforms and a metal barrier cutting off access to a small courtyard in front of the large DOJ doors. The group of protesters rallied at the barrier and the planters next to it that made up the square and homeowners slowly climbed over the barriers in an attempt to gain an audience at the DOJ and register their complaints. At that point, the police were keeping people from climbing over, but eventually the police retreated and a few homeowners and protesters made it over and sat down to occupy that space. More joined them. After about 10 minutes, as more climbed over the barrier and the crowd occupied more space, the police retreated up the few steps leading to the door, and eventually ceded the square entirely by going inside the DOJ, leaving the protesters and homeowners alone in the square. The protesters took down the barriers at that point and everyone occupied the square, complete with signs, chants, couches, tents, and the like. (There's video/photos of this on my Twitter feed, @j_ro.)
That was phase one -- for the next phase, the protest split into three groups, with one staying at the south entrance and the two others to take entrances on the north and west sides of the building. I went with the group going to the west, and we were met again by police presence at the west entrance. We pushed on through to the north entrance around the block, and again were met by police. After sitting down there for a bit and taking the intersection down the block, we were notified that our brethren needed our help back at the south entrance and we marched over.
When I got there with the crowd in my group, the police had about a dozen homeowners in plastic cuffs on the south steps and had set up a police line around the original square in front of the door. The people in my group rushed through the line to sit down with their fellow protesters and homeowners being arrested, and it was at this point that at least one officer took out his taser gun, pulled the trigger, and started using it to push back those in the crowd coming to the support of those being arrested. That's what you see in my video. As Matt noted, it was over very quickly, with protesters looking to peacefully support those who were being arrested being tased and pushed back, and those being arrested led into a police van and driven away for processing.
At this point, as the arrests were being loaded into the van, another group of about a dozen sat down inside the police barrier and as far as I know they're still there (I had to leave about an hour after the initial arrests). So there may be more arrests to come shortly.
There is nothing new about protesters gathering at government buildings. And it has never been a problem for the police to arrest protesters in an orderly fashion, even when the protesters are not cooperating by sitting down and refusing to move. This is the way civil disobedience has worked for many a moon. 
Shooting protesters full of electricity in order to get them to fall to the ground in excruciating pain, dazed and compliant, however, is new. And it's completely unnecessary, not to mention contrary to our long tradition of peaceful protest. I thought this sort of thing went out with the use of firehoses and police dogs.
It happened again today, this time well captured on video:
 
Note the casual sadism. The young woman is surrounded by three men as she links arms with another protester. She does not appear to be in any way violent or threatening. The big man behind her holds her around the neck and whispers in her ear (who knows what he told her, but if it's the usual, he says "cooperate right now or you're going to be tased.") As a peaceful protester engaged in civil disobedience she naturally refuses. At this point, they would normally pick her up bodily and carry her to the paddy wagon. Instead, they hit her with 50,000 volts of electricity, she crumbles to the ground as her whole body is overwhelmed by pain. 
And then they blithely walk away, leaving her writhing on the ground. Let's just say they were lucky she wasn't one of the thousands of people who've died from tasers. I guess they would have noticed at some point when she stopped screaming. 
This makes me sick to my stomach. And that it happened on the steps of the United States Department of Justice makes me ashamed to be an American. 
The woman who was tasered is named Carmen Pittman.  Here's her story.  I guess she just hasn't been punished enough.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Patrick Leahy withdrew his proposed amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have recognized the marriages of same-sex couples for immigration purposes on Tuesday night, after several Democratic members of the committee stated that they would not be supporting it.
A little past 7 p.m., Leahy said, “It is with a heavy heart … I will withhold the Leahy Amendment 7 at this point.”
Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, offered the amendment a half-hour earlier, saying, “I don’t want to be the senator who asks Americans to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country.”
He added, “Discriminating against people based on who they love is a travesty,” noting that he wanted to hear from members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators about why they didn’t include protections for gay couples in the initial bill.
Sen. Lindsey Graham went first, saying he opposed the inclusion of gay couples’ protections in the bill, despite noting his respect for Leahy’s “passion” is support of marriage equality.
“If you redefine marriage for immigration purposes [by the amendment], the bill would fall apart because the coalition would fall apart,” Graham said. “It would be a bridge too far.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein cited Graham’s comments, then, saying of Leahy’s amendment, “I think this sounds like the fairest approach, but here’s the problem … we know this is going to blow the agreement apart. I don’t want to blow this bill apart.”
She cited the fact that the Supreme Court could strike down the Defense of Marriage Act provision that prevents same-sex couples from having equal immigration rights in coming months. She also noted the a bill she is sponsoring to repeal DOMA is holding in the Senate, concluding, “I would just implore to hold up on this amendment at this time.”
Sen. Jeff Flake, another Republican in the Gang of Eight, said, “It certainly would mean this bill would not move forward.”
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic member of the Gang of Eight, then spoke up, praising Leahy’s leadership, but concluding, “I believe that this is the wrong moment, this is the wrong bill.”
Sen. Chuck Schumer went last of the four members of the Gang of Eight on the committee, saying, “This is one of the most excruciating decisions I have had to make in my [time] in Congress. … Not to do this is rank discrimination.”
He then said, however, of opponents of inclusion, “They’ve made it perfectly clear that if this provision is included … they will abandon [the bill.] … If we make the effort to add it to this bill, they will walk away. … The result: no equality, no immigration bill, everyone loses. … Much as it pains me, I cannot support this amendment if it will bring down the bill.’
“I will be here,” Schumer said to the LGBT community, to work on the issue in the future. “This is far from our last battle together.”
Sen. Al Franken, likewise, joined in the decision not to support the amendment, saying, “This is the definition of a Hobson’s choice. … It’s wrong to discriminate against people, but I do not want the LGBT people who would be hurt by this bill not passing, this whole bill not passing, to be hurt by this falling apart.”

There is no standard definition of the all-important term “wing nut,” so let’s provide one. A wing nut is someone who has a dogmatic commitment to an extreme political view (“wing”) that is false and at least a bit crazy (“nut”).
A wing nut might believe that George W. Bush is a fascist, that Barack Obama is a socialist, that big banks run the Department of the Treasury or that the U.S. intervened in Libya because of oil.
When wing nuts encounter people with whom they disagree, they immediately impugn their opponents’ motivations. Whatever their religion, they are devout Manicheans, dividing their fellow citizens into the forces of light and the forces of darkness.
Wing nuts have a lot of fellow travelers -- people who don’t fit the definition, yet who are similarly dogmatic and whose views, though not really crazy, aren’t exactly evidence-based. You can be a wing nut on a particular issue without being a wing nut in general. Most human beings can hear the voice, at least on occasion, of their inner wing nut.
The good news is that wing nuts usually don’t matter. The bad news is that they influence people who do. Sadly, more information often fails to correct people’s misunderstandings. In fact, it can backfire and entrench them. Can anything be done?
Stunning Conclusion
For a positive answer, consider an intriguing study by Philip Fernbach, a University of Colorado business school professor, and his colleagues. Their central finding is that if you ask people to explain exactly why they think as they do, they discover how much they don’t know -- and they become more humble and therefore more moderate.
The study came in four stages. First, people were asked to state their positions on a series of political issues, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, a national flat tax, merit-based pay for teachers and unilateral sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program. They were asked to describe their position on a seven-point scale whose endpoints were “strongly in favor” and “strongly opposed.”
Second, people were asked to rate their degree of understanding of each issue on a seven-point scale. The third step was the crucial one; they were asked to “describe all the details you know about [for example, the impact of instituting a ‘cap and trade’ system for carbon emissions ], going from the first step to the last, and providing the causal connection between the steps.” Fourth, people were asked to rerate their understanding on the seven-point scale and to restate their position on the relevant issue.
The results were stunning. On every issue, the result of requesting an explanation was to persuade people to give a lower rating of their own understanding -- and to offer a more moderate view on each issue. In a follow-up experiment, Fernbach and his co-authors found that after being asked to explain their views, people were less likely to want to give a bonus payment to a relevant advocacy group.
Interestingly, Fernbach and his co-authors found no increase in moderation when they asked people not to “describe all the details you know” about the likely effects of the various proposals, but simply to say why they believe what they do. If you ask people to give reasons for their beliefs, they tend to act as their own lawyers or public relations managers, and they don’t move toward greater moderation. The lesson is subtle: What produces an increase in humility, and hence moderation, is a request for an explanation of the causal mechanisms that underlie people’s beliefs.
Motivated Reasoning
In an unnoticed essay, the economist Albert Hirschman lamented the “overproduction of opinionated opinion.” He feared that strong opinions, as such, “might be dangerous to the health of our democracy,” because they can make it harder for people to understand one another and to find mutually agreeable solutions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are to be believed, the problem is curable -- at least if those who have “opinionated opinions” have less than solid foundations for their beliefs and if they can be convinced of that fact.
For wing nuts and their many fellow travelers, however, there is a serious obstacle, and it goes by the name of “motivated reasoning.” When people have a strong emotional attachment to their initial convictions, they tend to heap ridicule on anything that runs counter to those convictions and to give a lot of weight to anything that supports them.
Motivated reasoning helps to account for two defining characteristics of wing nuts and their fellow travelers: a readiness to attack people’s good faith, rather than their actual arguments, and an eagerness to make the worst, rather than the best, of opposing positions.
If Fernbach and his co-authors are right, this obstacle may not be insuperable. Serious efforts to examine the assumptions behind your own beliefs, and to identify what you don’t know, are likely to produce an increase in humility. Whether or not you change your view, you may well be humbled -- and end up being a bit more charitable to those who see things differently.

WASHINGTON | Tue May 21, 2013 5:50pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid expressions of horror, grief and resolve over the devastating tornado that smashed into suburban Oklahoma City, many lawmakers expressed relief on Tuesday that they took action in January to bulk up the FEMA disaster relief fund.
But Oklahoma's two senators, both Republicans, found themselves in an awkward position for having voted against the $60 billion supplemental appropriation bill that was largely aimed at providing relief to victims of Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into coastal New York and New Jersey last year.
The bill left the disaster fund run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a healthy balance of $11.6 billion. FEMA spokesman Dan Watson said the amount is sufficient for handling immediate response and recovery efforts in Oklahoma and residual recovery costs associated with Sandy.
In January, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe called the Sandy appropriations bill a "slush fund" because it included long-term infrastructure spending and funding for projects aimed at disasters other than the devastation along the U.S. East Coast.
The measure became embroiled in a tense budget fight over the "fiscal cliff" tax hikes in January and was delayed for several weeks for tempers to cool as FEMA's disaster fund rapidly dwindled.
On Tuesday, a day after a 2-mile (3-km) -wide tornado wiped out whole blocks of homes, killed at least 24 people and left thousands homeless in Moore, Oklahoma, Inhofe vowed that Oklahomans in need would not abuse federal disaster aid, as he said had occurred in the aftermath of Sandy.
"That's totally different," Inhofe told cable TV network MSNBC. "Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in Oklahoma."
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who also opposed the Sandy appropriation because it was not offset with budget savings elsewhere, pledged to make a similar "pay-for" demand if further disaster funds were needed. For now, however, he was focused on getting aid to the victims.
"As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I can assure Oklahomans that any and all available aid will be delivered without delay," Coburn said in a statement.
Representative Tom Cole, the Republican congressman whose district bore the brunt of the tornado - its second major disaster due to a twister in 14 years - had no explaining to do. He supported the Sandy legislation and pledged whatever resources were necessary to recover and rebuild devastated communities.
Cole, a moderate Republican with a reputation as a pragmatist, earned notoriety during the budget talks late last year as the first member of his party to advocate allowing higher tax rates on the wealthy in order to prevent tax increases on the vast majority of Americans.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he also helped trim some provisions from the Sandy bill that were unrelated to that disaster.
"I am confident we will get the help we need to make it through this tragedy. That is what Americans do for other Americans in tough times and challenging circumstances," Cole said in a statement.
Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski, also a Democrat, both pledged that if more money was needed for Oklahoma City, they would take action to fund it.
"This is a time for neighbor helping neighbor. This is not the time for a 'budgeteering' battle. This is a time to respond with compassion and competence," Mikulski of Maryland said in a statement.

Budget request calls for $200m to go towards military construction to upgrade temporary facilities at the prison.
Last Modified: 22 May 2013 00:07
Since his inauguration in January 2009, US President Barack Obama has pushed for shutting the prison [AFP]
The Pentagon is asking Congress for more than $450 million for maintaining and upgrading the Guantanamo Bay prison that President Barack Obama wants to close.
New details on the administration's budget request emerged on Tuesday and underscored the contradiction of the president waging a political fight to shutter the facility while the military calculates the financial requirements to keep the installation operating, AP news agency reported.
The budget request for the fiscal year beginning October 1 calls for $79m for detention operations, the same as the current year, and $20.5m for the office of military commissions, an increase over the current amount of $12.6m. The request also includes $40m for a fiber optic cable and $99 million for operation and maintenance.
The Pentagon also wants $200m for military construction to upgrade temporary facilities. That work could take eight to 10 years as the military has to transport workers to the island, rely on limited housing and fly in building material.
The facility at the US naval base in Cuba currently holds 166 prisoners, and hunger strikes by 100 of them over their indefinite detention and prison conditions prompted Obama to renew his effort to close Guantanamo.
'Not necessary'
The president is expected to discuss the future of the facility in a speech on counterterrorism on Thursday.
"Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe," the president said at a White House news conference last month. "It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."
Since his inauguration in January 2009, Obama has pushed for shutting the prison, signing an executive order for closure during his first week in office. He has faced resistance in Congress with Republicans and some Democrats repeatedly blocking efforts to transfer terror suspects to the United States.
The law that Congress passed and Obama signed in March to keep the government running includes a longstanding provision that prohibits any money for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States or its
territories. It also bars spending to overhaul any US facility in the US to house detainees.

Siena, Italy—Here’s a modest idea to break the gridlock, the stupidity, the meanness, the partisan lying and irresponsible ineffectiveness of modern Washington. We should consider returning to the Middle Ages.
Siena today is a small city of about 50,000 people, not much bigger than it was at its peak in the late 13th century. In those good and bad old days, it was a major manufacturing, mostly wool, and commercial center in Tuscany. The bad things were the Black Death—the plague of 1348, which wiped out more than its inhabitants, reducing it to a population that might have been as low as 16,000—and its repression by a larger neighbor, Florence. The good thing was that it was prevented from growing by those great troubles. Because of losing its struggles with its northern neighbor, much of Siena is still a beautiful and preserved city of the 14th century.
The other good and interesting thing about the city is how it was governed from 1277 to 1355. The largest building on the city’s spectacular oval Piazza del Campo, then and now, is the Palazzo Pubblico, were the city was governed by the "Nove," nine men selected by lottery and locked in the palace for two months at a time.
The idea: to keep away outsiders and outside influences—we call them special interests, lobbies and lawyers—as the "councillors" debated the problems and future of their city and then wrote its laws. The motives: to reduce the power of the Catholic Church, the richest institution in the area, and the power of aristocrats, members of the 56 families exercising military and commercial power.
One of the rooms in the palace, the "Sala della Pace," the room of peace, where the nine gathered, was decorated by murals—still visible today—showing dramatic instances of good and evil in government. The "Good Government" paintings show peace, prosperity and the virtues of Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, Prudence and Magnanimity—and, of course, Faith, Hope and Charity.

The "Bad Government" paintings show murder in the streets, soldiers carrying away women, and Justice bound in the chains of Tyranny.
Looked good to me. Unfortunately, the Council of Nine was overthrown by aristocrats and soldiers of Florence, who blamed the Nine for the plague destroying the city.
So where are we today in Washington? What will people hundreds of years from now think of our national governance with all its blaming, nastiness and negativity? It looks as if our country is being run by thugs and liars motivated by revenge and pettiness beyond description.
Our leaders are obsessed, it seems, with peripheral "scandals" and misjudgments, public relations arguments, talking points and plain old nonsense. A relevant critique of the current state of affairs in the IRS "scandal" was published a week or so ago by Michael Hiltzik, the economic columnist of the Los Angeles Times:
"It’s strange how ‘scandal’ gets defined these days in Washington. At the moment, everyone is screaming about the ‘scandal’ of the Internal Revenue Service scrutinizing conservative nonprofits before granting them tax-exempt status.
"Here are the genuine scandals in this affair: Political organizations are being allowed to masquerade as charities to avoid taxes and keep their donors secret, and the IRS has allowed them to do this for years.
"The bottom line first: The IRS hasn’t done nearly enough over the years to rein in the subversion of the tax law by political groups claiming a tax exemption that is not legally permitted for campaign activity. Nor has it enforced rules requiring that donors to those groups pay gift tax on their donations."
I’m with him. Lock up the leaders of our Republic and force them to deal with real issues—and with each other.

The bizarre behavior by the media giant reflects brewing tensions as it seeks to enter the US television market

(Updated below)
Last Tuesday, Al Jazeera English published a lengthy Op-Ed by  Columbia professor and Middle East scholar  Joseph Massad entitled "The Last of the Semites." Massad's argument was obviously controversial: he highlighted the shared goal between the early Zionist movement and Europe's anti-Jewish bigots (namely, the removal of Jews from the continent), detailed the cooperation between German Nazis and Zionists to facilitate the departure of Jews out of Europe (the existence of that cooperation is  not in dispute, though the extent of it very much is ), and highlighted the extensive disagreements among Jews themselves over the wisdom and justness of Zionism (large numbers of European Jews were insistent that they did not want to, and should not have to, leave their homelands for a distant land that was not theirs).
Predictably, numerous commentators -- largely the ones who have spent years  casually smearing as anti-semites  those who criticize Israel -- instantly and vehemently denounced Massad's arguments. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg  sarcastically tweeted : "Congratulations, al Jazeera: You've just posted one of the most anti-Jewish screeds in recent memory," while the editor of the neocon journal Commentary, John Podhoretz,  wrote : "Congratulations, donors to Columbia University, for paying this monstrous []head's salary!" A blogger for the Jerusalem Post  claimed that  " Massad's writings  on Israel can easily be confused with material from the neo-Nazi 'White Pride World Wide' hate site Stormfront."
All of that is par for the course when it comes to debates over Israel and Palestine: as any writer who ever ventures into that topic well knows, nothing triggers greater venom and personalized attacks (and a  greater risk of losing one's job ) than opining on any of these matters. And the critics of Massad's Op-Ed were doing nothing wrong per se: it's perfectly appropriate to harshly criticize controversial arguments that are published in a major media outlet. An intense debate was triggered about Massad's thesis, just as Massad and his Al Jazeera editors undoubtedly anticipated, and that is what opinion journalism often does and should do.
But all of that changed on Saturday. Without issuing any comment or explanation of any kind, unknown officials at Al Jazeera ordered Massad's Op-Ed to be deleted -- in essence, silently retracted. I actually discovered this deletion because, aware of the controversy that had erupted, I attempted on Saturday to read Massad's Op-Ed. But none of the specific Al Jazeera links I found would work: they all went to Al Jazeera's home page, which said nothing about Massad's Op-Ed. I finally was able to read the Op-Ed only by  finding it on blogs  which had re-printed the Op-Ed in full (a pdf version of how it appeared on Al Jazeera's site can be found  here ).
As a result, on Saturday morning I  asked on Twitter  whether Massad's Op-Ed had been deleted by Al Jazeera, and emailed several people who I believed had contacts with Massad and Al Jazeera to make the same inquiry. One of them, Ali Abunimah, then spoke with Massad and  reported  that Massad "had 'received confirmation' from his editor at Al Jazeera English that 'management pulled the article.'" Someone on Twitter  advised me  that the article could still be read in the mobile version of Al Jazeera's site, which I then  noted on Twitter , but by the end of that day, that, too, had been deleted. That Al Jazeera silently deleted an Op-Ed that it itself had published was then beyond dispute. In an email interview with me on Monday, Massad confirmed that his editor at Al Jazeera -- who had solicited Massad to write an Op-Ed for  Nakba Day  -- did not even know that it had been removed, and had to make several calls to confirm that it had been.
I spent much of the weekend emailing various Al Jazeera officials for comment, to no avail. Everyone either ignored my multiple inquires or said they were barred from commenting and referred me to the head of the outlet's PR department, who never responded. How can a media outlet possibly publish an Op-Ed, quietly delete it six days later in response to controversy, and then fail to utter a single word about what happened? Was there a fabrication or some glaring, retraction-worthy error in Massad's Op-Ed? Was it a mistake for Al Jazeera to have published it in the first place, and if so, who made that mistake, what was it, and why did it happen? Who made the decision to take the extraordinary step of deleting the Op-Ed, and what was the rationale for doing so?
No media outlet can possibly do something like this without publicly accounting for what happened and expect to retain credibility. How can you demand transparency and accountability from others when you refuse to provide any yourself? Refusing to comment on secret actions of this significance is the province of corrupt politicians, not journalists. It's behavior that journalists should be condemning, not emulating.
Media outlets do occasionally retract stories or even Op-Eds, but they then provide an explanation. Earlier this year, the Observer published a repellent Op-Ed by the British columnist Julie Burchill, which contained all sorts of ugly slurs against transgendered people (it was also published in the Guardian's online Comment is Free section). In the wake of intense condemnation, the Observer decided  to retract the Op-Ed and remove it from the site . The paper's editor, John Mulholland,  issued a statement  explaining the retraction, and the paper's readers editor (the rough British equivalent of an ombudsman), Stephen Pritchard, then wrote  a detailed account  of what happened.
Although I  condemned  the original Op-Ed, I did not agree with the decision to delete it. For one thing, it's a futile gesture: in the internet age, everything published is permanent. For another, it's contrary to the journalistic ethos: although it would have been appropriate to decide in the first instance not to publish it, once a decision is made to publish something, it should not be removed merely because it provokes controversy or even offense. Retractions should be reserved for serious factual errors. But at least the Observer transparently explained its actions and provided an account of what it did.
I'm not expressing any views here on the merit of Massad's arguments because that's irrelevant to the issue of Al Jazeera's conduct. I have spent years, both  as a lawyer  and then a writer, objecting to the suppression of all sorts of views which I find repellent, from  anti-gay  and  anti-Muslim bigotry  to  Ann Coulter  and  Ezra Levant's bile  to  Mohammed cartoons  to  advocacy of violence . I am a firm believer that, for multiple reasons, it is far preferable to air and then debunk even the most offensive ideas than it is to suppress them.
It's one thing for a media outlet to decide in the first instance not to publish an opinion piece on grounds of quality; it's another thing entirely for them to retract one they decide to publish simply because it offends people. Offending people is a necessary part of journalism and the fact that something produces offense is not evidence that it is invalid. Having media outlets afraid to publish opinions which offend people is a menacing state of affairs that nobody should want.
Massad is a provocative and controversial intellectual. Both he and the Al Jazeera editors who published this Op-Ed undoubtedly knew that many people would find the arguments both infuriating and offensive. There is nothing wrong with that: that's what good journalism does. Massad's Op-Ed led to some very aggressive and forceful criticisms of his arguments --  see here for one example  -- and that's exactly how it should be.
But deleting Massad's Op-Ed does not make this debate disappear. He did not invent these views. Indeed, as History Professor Daniel Myers  wrote recently in the Daily Beast , Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, made similar claims recently and actually wrote his dissertation on this topic at a Russian university. Professor Myers is quite hostile to the Abbas/Massad claim about the Zionist movement, labeling it "an historiographical sin of commission that rests on a faulty grasp of context and a distorted reading of the sources at hand," but the view is prevalent and held among credible scholars and influential politicians. Even Myers writes that "it must be noted there were periodic contacts between Zionists and Nazis before and during the War." Specifically:
"For example, in August 1933, the Zionist Federation of Germany signed an agreement with the German government (and the Anglo-Palestine Bank) known as the 'Haavara' (Transfer) which allowed for the transfer of Jewish property from Germany to Palestine as a means of encouraging Jewish emigration there. And during the War, Zionist officials in Palestine and elsewhere pursued a number of ransom plans whose goal was the liberation of European Jews. Perhaps the most well-known of these plans was the 'Merchandise for Blood' proposal of 1944 according to which one million Jews would be exchanged for 10,000 trucks. The negotiations were conducted between Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer for Jewish Affairs, and the Hungarian Zionists Joel Brand and Rudolf Kasztner."
Myers argues forcefully that these episodes were so limited that they do not remotely support the broad claims of Massad and Abbas. That's fine: that's what debates about history can and should entail. If you find the views of Professor Massad and the Palestinian president offensive, then you should want those views debated, not silenced. The solution is to debunk them, not suppress them, since they're not going anywhere.
Al Jazeera's deletion of this Op-Ed, and especially its refusal to provide any explanation for what happened here, is significant beyond just this one episode. Several people who work for the outlet, none of whom was willing to speak for attribution due to  fear of retaliation by the network's officials , say that Al Jazeera officials have become much more cautious and fearful ever since they  purchased Current TV last December  for $500 million and prepared to enter the US television market under the brand name "Al Jazeera America" (as disclosure: I had some preliminary discussions several months ago with some Al Jazeera officials about the possibility of doing something for that new network, though it never advanced beyond that stage; I also covered the US election for Al Jazeera English from Doha, and have appeared many times on that network).
In particular, these sources say, the primary impetus for the removal of the Op-Ed came from Ehab al-Shihabi, who was  recently named  to head the American TV network. They say that he is petrified that angering "pro-Israel" factions in the US will bolster the perception of Al Jazeera as both anti-American and anti-Israel, thus dooming the network with both corporate advertisers and cable carriers and render it radioactive among mainstream politicians. Al-Shihabi, they say, went to the network's top executive in Doha,  Director-General Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani , and demanded the removal of the Massad Op-Ed.
The tensions here reflect a broader internal conflict about how Al Jazeera intends to position itself as it enters American television. Many (and I include myself in this) believe that Al Jazeera can be successful only if they provide something that no other US cable news outlet regularly provides: fearless journalism of the type the network has displayed in the past, unconstrained by (and liberated from) the orthodoxies of the two dominant political parties and the airing of a wide range of views, including those typically excluded by mainstream US political television.
But several Al Jazeera executives have adopted the view, seemingly the one that is prevailing, that it should instead replicate the failed CNN model of risk-averse, viewpoint-free, colorless, soul-less "straight news reporting." That Al Jazeera's  first announced prime-time host  was the extremely uncontroversial, long-time CNN employee Ali Velshi, and is  reportedly considering  a horde of former CNN and NBC executives to run the network, illustrates the risk-averse, CNN-copying path they seem to be taking. Silently removing Massad's Op-Ed and then refusing to comment on it is behavior perfectly in line with that mentality.
All of this takes place in the context of  increasing criticisms from multiple quarters , at times  including its own journalists , that the ownership of Al Jazeera by the Emir of Qatar has increasingly affected, and degraded, its journalism, rendering it a propaganda tool for the Qatari dictatorship's foreign policy. Most of that criticism in the past had been directed at its flagship network, Al Jazeera Arabic. By contrast, Al Jazeera English has, by all appearances, remained largely independent, consistently producing truly outstanding and brave journalism.
The question is whether this can continue now that Al Jazeera is seeking to establish a serious TV presence in the US. The Qatari regime is a  close American ally ,  hosting several vital US military assets  used to wage the war in Iraq. But the regime has come under criticism  from US officials  and  "pro-Israel" commentators  for its support of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. It is hard to see how a US television network owned by the regime in Qatar will regularly broadcast journalism that is truly adversarial to its close ally, the US government, or air commentary that offends influential political factions in the US.
It's certainly possible that Al Jazeera America can provide unique and important journalism: networks owned by governments can and do produce real journalism. American cable news -- drowning in mindlessly partisan outlets that are endlessly focused on trivial Beltway gossip, along with the fear-driven pointlessness of CNN -- could certainly use an independent and intrepid journalistic competitor. Al Jazeera English has some outstanding, fearless journalists and produces some high-quality shows. But that will only happen if it remains independent of the Qatari regime's foreign policy aims and is free to risk offending and alienating powerful people:  the hallmark of good journalism . That's what makes its silent deletion of Massad's Op-Ed so alarming and disappointing: it signals that the network is being driven by exactly the corrupting fears that preclude meaningful, independent journalism.
For his part, Massad is convinced that it is Al Jazeera's imminent entrance into the US television market that caused the deletion of his Op-Ed. He wrote to me by email:
"It seems to me that if any media outlet, which still holds on to any expression of ideas that deviates from the established 'truths' of the American mainstream press, seeks to enter the US mainstream market, it will have to pay the heavy price of surrendering its right to air out such ideas and submit to the highly restrictive political line of the mainstream American media, especially on Israel. AJE has clearly shown that it is willing to pay such a price.
"When in the past Al-Jazeera resisted paying such a price, its journalists were targeted and killed by the US invading forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it was refused entry into the American system by refusing it cable access. The road of concessions began in the middle of the last decade when Arabic Aljazeera TV under an inordinate amount of US pressure stopped referring to the US invading forces in Iraq as 'American forces' but, as the US dictated, as 'Coalition forces.' It has been a slippery slope since then.
"Surprisingly, however, when Al-Jazeera changed its editorial line from one that was critical of US policies and interventions in the Arab world following the Libyan and Syrian uprisings, I criticized them harshly in  an interview with the Washington Post , but they continued to welcome my articles. When I criticized the Qatari Emir in the second article I wrote for them, I was not censored, and when I harshly criticized Qatari foreign policy since the Arab uprisings began, which I did in a number of articles, I was also not censored.
"It is ironic, though not shocking, that it was my criticisms of Israel and its Western allies that would be banned. . . . essentially neutralizing the remaining critical edge which made Al-Jazeera popular inside and outside the United States."
The way in which corporate influences on media outlets -- in ownership, in the need for advertisers, in not offending cable carriers -- restrict the range of permissible debate is a complex and vital topic. But whatever else is true, this episode provides a fairly potent illustration of how corrupting and restrictive those influences can be.
UPDATE
Just a few moments ago, Al Jazeera posted  an editor's note from Imad Musa , its Online Head for Al Jazeera English, entitled "In the Massad case, we should have done better." He writes that "Al Jazeera has always demanded transparency from the centres of power around the world, and we demand it from ourselves as well." After noting that he is re-publishing Massad's deleted Op-Ed, which is indeed published in full following the Editor's Note, Musa writes:
"We should have handled this better, and we have learned lessons that will enable us to maintain the highest standards of journalistic integrity.
"Our guiding principle has always been 'the opinion and other opinion.' Our pages have always been -- and will always be -- open to the most thought-provoking thinkers and writers from across the globe.
"Al Jazeera does not submit to pressure regardless of circumstance, and our history is full of examples where we were faced with extremely tough choices but never gave in. This is the secret to our success."
The note is still rather opaque, as it does not explain what happened, why it happened or who is responsible.

Crossing sacred lines in Washington
By    David Shribman
JewishWorldReview.com | You don't have to be a member of the Tea Party to be outraged over the Internal Revenue Service's special and unwarranted scrutiny of conservative groups. I'm not, and I am.
For four decades liberals have nursed hurts over the Nixon administration's use of the IRS to intimidate if not punish its political opponents. The very first item in Article II of the House Judiciary Committee resolution impeaching Nixon speaks of the "violation of the constitutional rights of citizens" and the improper examination of "confidential information contained in income tax returns."
One thing a second-term president wants to avoid is appearing in the same sentence with the word "Nixon," and so the IRS forays during the Obama years combined with the disclosure that the Justice Department obtained phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors puts the current administration in unusual peril.
Yes, the Nixon comparisons are superficial, and no, history never repeats itself, but yes, last week was a very bad one for President Barack Obama and portends rough weather ahead.
But these twin incursions into well-established rights -- violations of the trust and sense of fair-mindedness that government requires even if politics does not -- underline two principles that should be sacred, whether the president is a Republican or a Democrat, whether the timbre of the times is conservative or liberal:
Never mess with the work of an independent press. Never use the taxing authority of the government for political ends.
No two institutions of American governance are more precious and deserving of caution from officials who -- and here Republicans and Democrats are equally vulnerable to sin -- believe they have reason to deplore the one and abuse the other.
For generations Americans have been served by an independent press, which is one of the political and cultural distinctions of our civic life. And the entire functioning of our government requires that the power to tax--which both Daniel Webster and John Marshall equated in 1819 with the power to destroy -- be deployed with antiseptic fairness.
So there are two scandals here, and all Americans should be concerned about them both. But there is a third scandal unearthed by last week's events, and it comes under the familiar dictum, often attributed to fellow columnist Michael Kinsley, that scandal usually isn't about what's illegal, but what is legal.
Here is what is legal and at the heart of this month's contretemps: It is legal for 501(c)(4) organizations -- conservative groups such as the various permutations of the Tea Party as well as many liberal groups such as PrioritiesUSA -- to have tax exemptions under the claim that they are primarily involved in the promotion of social welfare. The promotion of social welfare is an elusive concept often having little to do with social welfare and often having to do with politics. Its virtue is almost always in the eyes of the beholder, if not the donor.
This is not a new issue in Washington. More than nine months ago, 10 Republican senators, including some regarded by Democrats as among the most open-minded and even-handed of their rivals, contacted Douglas H. Schulman, the IRS commissioner, to express concern that political factors were affecting the agency's activities.
Nine years ago the American Bar Association created a task force to examine this question and found there was "no statutory basis" for the principle "that social welfare does not include political intervention." Indeed, in 1990 -- smack in the middle of a Republican administration -- the director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Technical Division told a conference (and you can imagine what a lively, fun-packed convention this was):
"When it comes to political activities, that is, giving money to a candidate, telling people to vote for a certain candidate, the rule is that it has to be less than primary. If it's 49 percent of their income, that is less than primary."
That's the principle guiding the use of all that principal. But it's not a good one, as it allows all sorts of groups to raise enormous amounts of money and then devote 49 percent of it to political purposes without tax exposure. Some estimates put the ad spending by these tax-exempt groups at more than half a billion dollars during the last election cycle.
Last week an unusual breeze of fairness blew through the capital, often from unlikely sources. Consider these remarks from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada:
"There are these shadowy political groups masquerading as social welfare organizations in order to solicit anonymous donations from we don't know who -- big corporations and also wealthy people. That needs to stop. We do not know exactly how much money was spent in the last election by these groups, and I acknowledge most of the money was spent on the right wing, but there was plenty on the left wing."
Here is the scary thing: USAToday reports that the IRS approved nonprofit status for liberal groups at the same time it was denying that status for conservative groups. Rhetoricians at the University of Pittsburgh and Jesus College, Cambridge, have developed a theory of "keywords," and it doesn't take a Pitt or Cambridge degree to ascertain the political leanings of a group with a name such as Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, which received tax-exempt status at the time when Tea Party groups employing words such as "patriot" did not.
None of this is good for the Obama administration, which otherwise would have had something big to crow about last week. Revised nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office figures put the federal budget deficit at $642 billion. That marks a $203 billion improvement from earlier forecasts -- and eerily, $203 billion was the size of the 1981 deficit, expressed in today's dollars, that propelled Ronald Reagan into office.
But that wasn't the predominant discussion of the week. Instead, the talk was of how the administration breached some of the most sacred lines in American life. First Amendment purists are right that attacking press prerogatives is an attack on American values. And maybe conservatives are right about taxes, because the type of flat tax they espouse could help take the IRS out of politics and make all of these exemptions meaningless.

Submitted by Tyler Durden on  05/21/2013 11:54 -0400
Ben Bernanke
Two years ago, Zero Hedge first made the observation that the bulk of Fed reserves (also known simply as "cash created out of thin air" because money is first and foremost fungible no matter what textbook theoreticians may claim, and the only cash allocation preference is the capital allocation IRR analysis) had been parked not with US banks, but with foreign banks with US-based operations. We followed that with more analyses , showing explicitly how the Fed was providing a constant cash injection to foreign banks courtesy of the rate on overnight reserves which is the amount Fed pays to banks that hold reserves with it, as the bulk of reserves continued to end up with foreign banks - a situation set to become a huge political storm some time in 2014-2015 when the IOER has to rise and the Fed is "found" to have injected tens of billions of "interest" not into US banks but in foreign banks operating in the US, and which then can upstream the "profits" to insolvent offshore domiciled holding companies.
So it was our expectation that while if not slowing down its rate of money-creation (i.e., reserve-production) - something that won't happen for a long time as it would crash the stock market - the Fed's reserves would at least revert to being accumulated at US-based banks. No such luck. In fact as the latest H.8 report demonstrates, as of the most recently weekly data, the Fed's policies have led to foreign banks operating in the US holding an all time high amount of reserves, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time, or $1,033 billion to be precise.
This means that, as we expected several months ago, the only recipient of ongoing Fed money printing are not US banks, but foreign banks operating in the US. For those confused about the big picture, here is a chart showing the breakdown of cash held by big and small US banks as well as foreign banks, superimposed to total reserves created by the Fed since the start of the Great Financial Crisis. The correlation is 100%.
And just to prove that ALL the unsterilized cash from both QE2 and QEternity has essentially gone to support offshore banks, here is the conclusive chart showing the change in Fed reserves and cash held by foreign banks:
Finally, tying it all together, here is chart showing cash at US banks vs cash at foreign banks operating in the US. At $1.03 trillion in foreign cash, the Fed's policies have once again led to more cash being held by foreign banks than all cash held by domestic banks.
We are confident that we speak for all when we say: "Thank you Ben - insolvent foreign banks appreciate your ongoing QE2 and QEternity-funded generosity"

Exactly why this will end badly. The Bernak must print to make up for our lack of production. To support our consumption the major export nations need a steady stream of  debt.  The problem is the Bernank is destroying the debt's buying power in order to fund our duel deficits. Eventually it will get kicked rejected by the suppliers.

Petraeus’s role in drafting Benghazi talking points raises questions
FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES - Former CIA director David Petraeus addresses a University of Southern California event honoring the military on March 26 in Los Angeles.

The controversy over the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attack last year began at a meeting over coffee on Capitol Hill three days after the assault.
It was at this informal session with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the ranking Democrat asked David H. Petraeus, who was CIA director at the time, to ensure that committee members did not inadvertently disclose classified information when talking to the news media about the attack.

“We had some new members on the committee, and we knew the press would be very aggressive on this, so we didn’t want any of them to make mistakes,” Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.) said last week of his request in an account supported by Republican participants. “We didn’t want to jeopardize sources and methods, and we didn’t want to tip off the bad guys. That’s all.”
What Petraeus decided to do with that request is the pivotal moment in the controversy over the administration’s Benghazi talking points. It was from his initial input that all else flowed, resulting in 48 hours of intensive editing that congressional Republicans cite as evidence of a White House coverup.
A close reading of recently released government e-mails that were sent during the editing process, and interviews with senior officials from several government agencies, reveal Petraeus’s early role and ambitions in going well beyond the committee’s request, apparently to produce a set of talking points favorable to his image and his agency.
The information Petraeus ordered up when he returned to his Langley office that morning included far more than the minimalist version that Ruppersberger had requested. It included early classified intelligence assessments of who might be responsible for the attack and an account of prior CIA warnings — information that put Petraeus at odds with the State Department, the FBI and senior officials within his own agency.
The only government entity that did not object to the detailed talking points produced with Petraeus’s input was the White House, which played the role of mediator in the bureaucratic fight that at various points included the CIA’s top lawyer and the agency’s deputy director expressing opposition to what the director wanted.
“What [committee members] were looking for was the lowest common denominator,” said a senior administration official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the editing process. “That’s not what the agency originally produced.”
Petraeus did not respond to e-mailed requests to clarify questions surrounding his role in drafting and reviewing the talking points. He resigned as CIA director in November after details of an extramarital affair became public.

At 9:42 p.m. Sept. 11, 2012, as violent anti-American demonstrations unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa over an anti-Islam video made in the United States, a group of armed men attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

posted at 10:01 pm on May 21, 2013 by Mary Katharine Ham
The idea that this targeting practice was isolated in some off-shoot Ohio office was preposterous from the beginning. Even if no other office were involved, Cincinnati is the central office for clearing tax-exempt applications and has been since the late ’90s. Its location in Cincinnati just gave apologists a convenient way to imply it was not involved in carrying out a national policy.
Since the early days of this scandal, we’ve learned, even if it was buried in the Style section of the Washington Post, there was a “directive.”
Now, National Review‘s Eliana Johnson reports there was guidance from Washington’s Technical Unit after the directive:
From the outset, Internal Revenue Service lawyers based in Washington, D.C., provided important guidance on the handling of tea-party groups’ applications for tax-exempt status, according to both IRS sources and the inspector general’s report released in mid May.
Officials in the Technical Unit of the IRS’s Rulings and Agreements office played an integral role in determining how the targeted applications were treated, provided general guidelines to Cincinnati case workers, briefed other agency employees on the status of the special cases, and reviewed all those intrusive requests demanding “more information” from tea-party groups. At times, the Technical Unit lawyers seemed to exercise tight control over these applications, creating both a backlog in application processing and frustration among Cincinnati agents waiting for direction.
An IRS employee who asked not to be identified tells National Review Online that all members of the agency’s Technical Unit are based in Washington, D.C. A current list of Technical Unit managers provided by another IRS employee shows that all such managers are based at the agency’s headquarters on Constitution Avenue in the District of Columbia, and the IRS confirmed, in a testy exchange with National Review Online, that the Technical Unit is “based in Washington.”
An example of such routine elevation of a case to Washington was in the IG report, despite the IG’s testimony that the practice took place with “little or no supervisory review.”
On May 17, 2010, according to the IG report, Determinations Unit specialists in Cincinnati handling tea-party applications were instructed to “send additional information request letters to the Technical Unit for review prior to issuance.” Ten days later, the Technical Unit “began reviewing additional information request letters prepared by the Determinations Unit.”
The IG report indicates this became a source of frustration, and specialists in Cincinnati pressed for a streamlined approach. “Why does the Technical Unit need to review every additional information request letter when a template letter could be approved and used on all the cases?” they asked via e-mail. The Washington unit rejected this approach and, in February 2011, was developing individualized letters itself. According to the IG report, an update from the Technical Unit acting manager to the Determinations Unit manager indicated, “Letters were being developed and would be reviewed shortly.”
Meanwhile the ever-changing stories of the White House have lost…Howard Fineman:
We still don’t know the details of how the special scrutiny of conservative groups began in 2010, who approved it, or who first learned about it higher up at the IRS and the Treasury Department. The White House says that it knew nothing about the matter until the counsel received a heads up about the pending IG report.
And yet tea party and other conservative groups had been complaining about the IRS scrutiny since 2010, and IRS officials had publicly reassured members of Congress that there was nothing unusual or unwarranted going on.
With two winning presidential campaigns built on successful grassroots fundraising, with a former White House counsel (in 2010-11) who is one of the Democrats’ leading experts on campaign law (Bob Bauer), with former top campaign officials having been ensconced as staffers in the White House (David Axelrod, who left for the reelection campaign in early 2011, and Dan Pfeiffer among others), it’s hard to imagine that the Obama inner circle was oblivious to the issue of what the IRS was doing in Cincinnati.
That may well be true. Maybe they didn’t care one whit what the IG was going to say. But they sure haven’t been behaving that way in the last week.
Hey, at least now we know the federal government is intent on harassing law-abiding entities equally in one sense— from the most modest Kitchen Table Patriots to the riches of Apple . What were the flags for Apple? “Profit-seeking” and “success?” Did you notice how very loquacious Jay Carney was today during the White House press briefing about Apple’s tax situation despite his previous professions that the IRS is an “independent agency.” I wonder why it’s not “improper” for the White House to comment on an ongoing inquiry in this case, hm?

The reason people listen to this guy is the whole paranoid Us vs Them mentality. The media is clearly against us so they are a terrorist organization. I'm not sure if they understand what a terrorist organization is. The media needs to show the truth and reality a lot better, but it's not a terrorist organization. The﻿ media needs less bias. It's owned by corporations of course. As Jimmy Dore said "CNN shows the bombs taking off. Al-Jazeera show the bombs landing." We need more honesty.

Senator John McCain just interviewed Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company's taxes and offshore profits. 
But the kicker came at the end, when McCain stopped his line of questioning by asking, "Why the hell do I have to keep updating apps on my iPhone all the time?"
Cook responded, "Sir, we're trying to make them better all the time."
McCain does have a point. It's really annoying to pop open the App Store every time there's a new update. We wish iPhones worked more like Android phones in that respect, letting you update apps automatically.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced an amendment to the farm bill Monday that would allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, an aide told HuffPost.
The "Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2013" would exclude industrial hemp, which is not a drug, from classification as "marihuana," removing it from the federal laws against growing pot, and allowing for regulation by the states.
Wyden told HuffPost he planned to talk to Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who is floor-managing the farm bill, about the provision. "For me, what's important is that people see, particularly in our state, there's someone buying it at Costco in Oregon," Wyden said in a brief interview in the Capitol. "I adopted what I think is a modest position, which is if you can buy it at a store in Oregon, our farmers ought to be able to make some money growing it."
The amendment was cosponsored by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Its introduction follows a failed effort by the two Republican senators to insert a similar provision into the base of the bill. The attempt was blocked by Democrats, amid a flurry of palace intrigue, who insisted McConnell press forward with a vote. Inserting it into the bill would have made it more likely for the provision to become law. The floor approach will require 60 votes.
Wyden has long been an advocate for allowing American farmers to grow hemp, which he said will create jobs and economic growth.
Last June, he introduced a farm bill amendment that would allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, but couldn't get it to a vote.
“I firmly believe that American farmers should not be denied an opportunity to grow and sell a legitimate crop simply because it resembles an illegal one," Wyden wrote at the time . "I’m confident that if grassroots support continues to grow and Members of Congress continue to hear from voters then common sense hemp legislation can move through Congress in the near future.”
Several states, including Oregon, Vermont and Kentucky, already allow for hemp licensure, but need the federal law amended before farmers can begin planting.
"We are optimistic that the hemp amendment to the farm bill will pass and be attached," said Tom Murphy, the national outreach coordinator for Vote Hemp, which aims to legalize hemp farming. "We just received word from [farm advocacy group] Rural Vermont that Sen. Patrick Leahy will support the amendment."

Albany
The sheriffs thought they were being summoned to the Capitol to discuss ideas for changes to New York's gun control law, the SAFE Act. Instead, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told them to keep quiet.
Opposition to the new law has simmered in upstate areas since Cuomo signed the law in January. Many county sheriffs oppose it, particularly its expanded definition of banned assault weapons, and have spoken out around the state. In January, the New York State Sheriffs' Association wrote Cuomo with an analysis, and later suggested tweaks.
Cuomo invited its leaders to the Capitol last month, people briefed on the meeting said. The group included Sheriffs' Association Executive Director Peter Kehoe and Chemung County Sheriff Christopher Moss .
"We didn't get a response (to the analysis) from him, but we could tell after the budget was passed that none of those recommendations were taken into consideration," Moss said. "When we got there, we never got to the contents of the letter."
Instead, Cuomo pushed the sheriffs to stop publicly speaking out against the act, Moss said.
"The governor was of the opinion that the sheriffs around the state should not be interjecting their personal opinions in reference to the law," Moss said, adding that Cuomo said sheriffs can't do that and enforce the law.
One person briefed on the meeting said Cuomo threatened to remove sheriffs from office, a little-used power afforded the state's chief executive under the state constitution. Moss would not confirm this. He did say the meeting was heated at times, but overall he described it as "cordial."
Kehoe did not return calls, and Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi declined to comment. An administration official, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss a private meeting, "strongly" denied Cuomo had threatened to remove any sheriff.
Last week, the Sheriffs' Association as well as several elected sheriffs filed an amicus curiae brief supporting a federal challenge to the SAFE Act.
"We're not really protesting the law; we're protesting the methodology in which the law was forced upon the people without input of the people," said Livingston County Sheriff John York , a Republican who chairs the group's executive committee.
Erie County Sheriff Tim Howard has said he "won't enforce" the act.
Cuomo has said the law will "save lives."
The law broadened the definition of banned assault weapons, increased penalties for illegal gun possession, reduced public access to gun permit information and required mental health professionals to report concerns about a gun-owning patient who posed a risk of harming himself or others. It bans any magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds, and bars people from loading magazines with more than seven cartridges.
The bill was unveiled on Jan. 14 and passed through a "message of necessity" that waived a three-day waiting period. The Senate, led by a Republican-dominated coalition, passed the bill by a 43-18 vote hours after the text became public. The Democrat-dominated Assembly passed it the next day, and Cuomo signed it.
In the amicus brief, the sheriffs wrote: "Law enforcement's work is made more difficult attempting to enforce unclear laws that harm, rather than promote, public safety. The laws appear willfully blind to legitimate safety interests, and instead are tailored to impact, and negatively impact, law-abiding firearm owners."
Asked last week about the court brief, Cuomo said, "They're free to litigate — God bless America."
He did not directly say if he thought sheriffs should speak out against laws they enforce, but said, "They're politicians. They run for office, too."
On Monday, Cuomo said Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola was "not upholding the law" when he said last week he would refuse to release permit-holder information. The law allows permit holders to make their information exempt from state Freedom of Information Law disclosure if they apply and meet set criteria.
Merola, a Republican, said that sifting through the applications would take resources his office cannot spare. Instead, he will not release any pistol permit data.
"That's not for a county clerk to do on a blanket basis," Cuomo said. "You can't decide what the law is or change the law — their job is to enforce the law administratively."

The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Obama administration's media investigations on two fronts on Tuesday.
The CPJ board sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Deputy Attorney General James Cole protesting the Justice Department's secret probe into the Associated Press . The board--whose members include Christiane Amanpour, Lara Logan, Tom Brokaw, Victor Navasky, Michael Massing and the Huffington Post Media Group's editor-in-chief, Arianna Huffington--said that it was doing something rare:
Our board of directors rarely has seen the need to raise its collective voice against U.S. government actions that threaten newsgathering. Today, however, we do see that need: We write you to vigorously protest the secret seizing of phone records of The Associated Press. The overly broad scope of the secret subpoena and the lack of notification to the AP by the Justice Department represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States.
The CPJ added that the Justice Department had "set a terrible example for the rest of the world, where governments routinely justify intervention in the media by citing national security." The letter also demanded, as the AP has, that any materials obtained in the DOJ probe be returned immediately to the AP. (Read the full letter here .)
In a separate release , the CPJ said it was "alarmed" at the Justice Department's secret investigation into Fox News reporter James Rosen.
"U.S. government efforts to prosecute leakers by obtaining information from journalists has a chilling effect domestically and sends a terrible message to journalists around the world who are fighting to resist government intrusion," CPJ head Joel Simon said in a statement.

Exclusive: Pamela Geller calls for immediate halt of immigration by Muslims
Published: 6 hours ago

The Washington Times reported Sunday that “the Homeland Security Department has granted legal status to 99.2 percent of all illegal immigrants who have applied under President Obama’s new non-deportation policy for young adults, according to the latest numbers released Friday.”
It’s another giant middle finger to the American people by the Obama administration, endangering national security and guaranteeing higher unemployment. Supporters of this policy, according to the Times, “say the high rate makes sense given the motivated pool of youngsters, known as ‘Dreamers’ because of the Dream Act legislation that would give them full citizenship rights.”
Yes, the motivated pool of youngsters like Al Harbi, the Saudi “person of interest” whose role in the Boston Marathon jihad bombing has never been adequately explained, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston jihad bomber himself, or Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari (building bombs to use on the home of George W. Bush, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, nightclubs and the homes of soldiers) or Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh (who plotted to bomb a New York synagogue and the Empire State Building) or Amine El Khalifi (who plotted a suicide bombing plot of U.S. Capitol) or Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis (who plotted to bomb the Manhattan office of the Federal Reserve Bank) and so many other highly motivated youngsters.
We have been importing jihadists for years now with Muslim immigration programs under the Refugee Resettlement program , diversity visas and religious visas . The Refugee Council USA says: “The U.S. has historically maintained a policy of admitting refugees of special humanitarian concern into the country.” Yet what that means in practice is very different from what most Americans would expect. It’s always a shock to people when they first find out how Refugee Resettlement works. Instead of giving refuge to the religious minorities that are persecuted, oppressed and subjugated under the Shariah, we are opening the floodgates to Islamic supremacists and jihadists.
And what most folks don’t know is that it’s the OIC -driven U.N. that decides who gets refugee status. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) determines which of the world’s “huddled masses” comes to the U.S. as humanitarian refugees. According to a 2008 report (and little has changed since then), “major refugee ‘hot spots’ include the Horn of Africa with Somalia, Darfur in the Sudan and Ethiopia, Iraq, Pakistan and Myanmar. The U.S. is the third-highest ranked country in terms of hosting refugees. The annual budget for the UNHCR is over $1.7 billion derived from government contributions, foundation grants and donations.”
Here’s the thing. Anthony Kimery reported in Homeland Security Today last week that “the threat of ‘homegrown’ and foreign jihadist groups and individuals plotting mass casualty attacks on U.S. soil has not weakened, despite degradation of al-Qaida Central (AQC). … Authorities said there is an exceptionally ‘heightened concern’ regarding intelligence that the successful radicalization of Muslims and new converts to jihad in the U.S. and throughout the West who’ve been involved in mass casualty plots and plotting has resulted in inspiring of a legion of ‘inspired’ new jihadists, many of whom are ‘quite willing’ to carry out mass casualty attacks, including suicide martyr attacks.”
This is a direct result of the huge influx of whole Muslim communities from jihad areas and nations into the U.S. since 9/11. The Obama administration is importing whole Muslim communities from Islamic countries like Somalia. The “diversity” immigration numbers are doubling , tripling in some months. This immigration must stop. Many of these devout Muslims do not assimilate. They agitate for jihad, and many return to Somalia (or Pakistan, Afghanistan) for training. Why are we importing hostile invaders?
We should be importing whole Christian communities or Hindu communities, etc., that are living (and dying) under the boot of the Shariah. I know several people (Jews among them) who are trying to get out of Europe and Canada, and they are prohibited from emigrating. These include the best of people, businessmen (who would bring jobs), doctors, etc. They have met years of red tape and denial. Further, I must field three or four emails a day from former Muslims in Egypt, Mauritania, Gaza, etc., begging me to help them escape their dangerous circumstances. Again, brick wall.
But jihadists with “insurgent histories”? Welcome. Why? “Refugee resettlement.”
My organization, the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), has called for an immediate halt of immigration by Muslims into nations that do not currently have a Muslim majority population, and with good reason. There is no chance of that being implemented anytime soon. But it may one day soon become a matter of our national survival.

By PAUL ELIAS Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO May 21, 2013 (AP)

A federal court Tuesday struck down Arizona's ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy absent a medical emergency.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the law violated a woman's constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is able to survive outside the womb. "Viability" of a fetus is generally considered to start at 24 weeks. Normal pregnancies run about 40 weeks.
Nine other states have enacted similar bans starting at 20 weeks or even earlier. Several of those bans had previously been placed on hold or struck down by other courts.
Judge Marsha Berzon, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel on the San Francisco-based court, said such bans before viability violate a long string of U.S. Supreme Court rulings starting with the seminal Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.
The judge wrote that "a woman has a constitutional right to choose to terminate her pregnancy before the fetus is viable."
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the ban into law in April 2012 after it was approved by the Republican-led Legislature. Supporters said the law was meant to protect the mother's health and prevent fetuses from feeling pain. U.S. District Judge James Teilborg ruled it was constitutional, partly because of those concerns, but the 9th Circuit blocked the ban from going into effect until it ruled.
Lawyers representing Arizona argued that the ban wasn't technically a law but rather a medical regulation because it allowed for doctors to perform abortions in medical emergencies. Berzon rejected that reasoning and deemed the legislation a law banning abortions before a fetus is viable.
"The challenged Arizona statute's medical emergency exception does not transform the law from a prohibition on abortion into a regulation of abortion procedure," Berzon wrote. "Allowing a physician to decide if abortion is medically necessary is not the same as allowing a woman to decide whether to carry her own pregnancy to term."
Berzon was joined by judges Mary Schroeder and Andrew Kleinfeld.
Supporters of the ban vowed to keep fighting.
"Given the compelling and important interest Arizona has in protecting the health and well-being of expectant mothers from the dangers of abortions after 20 weeks and to protect children in the womb from needless and horrific imposition of pain, we will seek review from the United States Supreme Court," said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, who argued in support of the ban before the court. "If the 9th Circuit cannot permit Arizona to act because of Supreme Court precedent, then the Supreme Court must change that precedent."
Republican State Sen. Kimberly Yee, who sponsored the legislation, said she "wasn't surprised" by the ruling because of the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation.
"I'm optimistic that the state will have a compelling argument if we move this before the Supreme Court," Yee said.
Yee said she is 20 weeks pregnant.
"I certainly have no doubt in my mind that the baby I'm carrying at 20 weeks is a life," she said.
The 9th Circuit's ruling is binding only in the nine Western states under the court's jurisdiction, and Idaho is the only other state in the region with a similar ban. A federal judge earlier declared Idaho's ban unconstitutional.
Janet Crepps, a lawyer who argued against the ban in court for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the ruling Tuesday affirmed a woman's right to an abortion before viability.
"These laws are all unconstitutional," she said. "This is not a close legal question at all. These laws are unconstitutional."

The tyrants of our modern age are smart enough not to declare themselves to be tyrants. They simply don't follow the rules that have been set for the common citizens. The other smart move that they have made is that the real tyrants don't put themselves in the supposed positions of power. Does anyone really believe that the President is the top of the food chain in Washington? But if the political puppets aren't the tyrants, then who are? The ones who can't get prosecuted for their crimes, obviously.

/ Facebook
(CBS) SEBASTIAN, Fla. - A Florida state attorney says the charges against Kaitlyn Hunt, an 18-year-old high school student who engaged in a same-sex relationship with a 15-year-old classmate, will not be dropped, despite petitions from the public, CBS affiliate WTSP reports.
PICTURES: Fla. teen charged over underage same-sex relationship
Hunt has been expelled from Sebastian River High School in Sebastian, Fla. and is charged with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery of a child 12 to 16 years of age as a result of the relationship.
The case began in February after the younger girl's parents notified authorities when Hunt turned 18. Since then, the story has garnered national attention for what some say is a gay rights issue.
Kelly Hunt Smith, Kaitlyn's mother, created a Facebook page to gain support for her daughter in an effort to get the charges dropped, the station says. The page, entitled "Free Kate," had over 30,000 members as of early Tuesday.
Smith posted on the page that the girlfriend's parents "conspired with police to entrap Katilyn" because they disapproved of the relationship.
A similar petition on Change.org was set up by Kaitlyn's father, Steven Hunt, and has more than 56,500 supporters calling for prosecutors to drop the charges.
Steven Hunt claims his daughter's relationship with the 15-year-old girl was consensual and that the girlfriend's parents went to police because they blamed Katilyn for their child's homosexuality, WTSP reports.
The Indian River County Sheriff's Office held a press conference Monday in response to the public's uproar.
"If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl, it would have been prosecuted the same way," Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said.
According to the station, Florida's law says any person who engages in sexual activity with a minor between the ages of 12 and 16 commits the crime of lewd and lascivious battery.
"The idea is to protect people in that vulnerable group from people who are older, 18 and above," Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th circuit, said, according to the station. "...The statute specifically says that consent is not a defense."
Colton said prosecutors will not drop the charges based on the public petition. He said this case exemplifies the purpose of the current law and added he would not support any effort to make consensual relationships among peers legal, the station reports.
"There's a big maturity difference between them," he said. "You're talking the difference between a senior in high school and a freshman in high school. That's what the law is designed to protect."
The second-degree felony charges are reportedly punishable by up to 15 years in prison and could require the individual to register as a sex offender. Colton told WTSP Hunt has until Friday to accept a plea agreement that would subject her to two years of house arrest followed by a year of probation.
According to an arrest affidavit obtained by WTSP, Kaitlyn and her girlfriend began dating in November 2012. The victim reportedly told police they began a sexual relationship and according to the report, the victim was 14 and Kaitlyn was 18.
As part of the investigation, Indian River county detectives reportedly a recorded phone call between the two high school students to develop grounds for an arrest. In the call, Kaitlyn told the girl she loved her, the station reports.

Apple and Corporate Taxes
by EILEEN APPELBAUM
A “territorial” tax system – in which overseas profits of U.S. corporations would be lightly taxed in the U.S. or not taxed at all – is likely to be the top tax reform proposal advocated by Apple CEO Tim Cook when he testifies before the Senate on Tuesday.
Apple – like hundreds of other high-tech and pharmaceutical companies that enjoy enormous profits from royalties or licensing agreements – is able to attribute these profits to offshore subsidiaries located in low-tax havens like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands even when sales revenue and profits are earned primarily in the U.S.
Under current law, these companies continue to owe taxes to the U.S. Treasury on these overseas earnings, as technically, the taxes have only been deferred. But the taxes don’t come due until the profits are repatriated – that is, brought back to the U.S. parent company. A territorial tax system would let these companies repatriate profits without paying the U.S. taxes they owe.
The argument in favor of allowing companies to repatriate offshore profits while paying no tax or a small tax in the U.S. is that corporations will put these funds to work here at home. The promised payoff is increased investment, increased employment and increased economic growth. There is good reason to be skeptical of this promise.
The U.S. tried just such a tax break in 2004, declaring a temporary tax holiday for offshore profits. According to a  report  by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, approximately one-third of offshore profits were repatriated in the following year. Academic studies, however, found no evidence that companies used the repatriated profits to increase investment or employment and no evidence that they increased economic activity.
Instead, they freed up other funds that these companies used for stock buybacks and to pay dividends to corporate shareholders. Indeed, many of the companies that benefited from the tax holiday on offshore profits actually reduced employment in the U.S.
It is also a myth that these profits are languishing in offshore in low-tax jurisdictions. According  to the Wall Street Journal, a lot of this cash is actually held in U.S. banks or invested in U.S. government and corporate securities. As long as these profits don’t come back to the parent company, they are not taxed in the U.S. But this cash is already at work in the U.S. economy – which undermines the argument that a territorial tax system would bring huge hoards of cash back for investment. The only thing companies can’t do with these funds is reward shareholders.
U.S. companies are supposed to account for offshore profits by setting aside funds to cover future tax liabilities when these profits are repatriated. Few companies actually do this. Most simply declare that the funds have been permanently invested overseas, which frees them from this obligation. Google, Oracle, Microsoft and numerous other companies have taken this route. As a result, these highly profitable companies owe very little in corporate income taxes.
Apple, which currently has $102.3 billion in offshore profits, has not taken advantage of this provision. Its accounts show that it has set aside billions of dollars to cover future tax liabilities on offshore profits. According to the Financial Times, Apple set aside  $5.8 billion  last year, 70 percent of its reported tax liability, for this purpose. This boosted Apple’s apparent corporate tax rate to 25.2 percent – far above Google, Microsoft and others – and spared the company the public outrage directed at highly profitable companies that pay little or no corporate income taxes. However, the $5.8 billion is an accounting entry that had no effect on the actual taxes Apple paid.
A territorial tax system would further increase incentives to locate jobs in low-tax countries, as profits earned in these countries could more easily flow back to U.S. shareholders. A better solution is to eliminate deferral of taxes on profits stashed offshore and, instead, to allocate taxes on profits based on its activity in various jurisdictions.
About half of U.S. states that have a corporate income tax use such a method for U.S. companies that operate in multiple states. Earlier this year, California adopted a sales-based corporate tax system that taxes companies that sell products or services in California, no matter where in the world they are located, based on the proportion of their total sales revenue generated in the state. This could serve as an example for tax reform that is both  simple and fair .

The Justice Department obtained the phone records for at least five different numbers used by Fox News as part of a leak investigation, the New Yorker revealed on Tuesday . In addition, the magazine reported, the DOJ acquired the records for two different White House lines.
The report, by Ryan Lizza, suggests that the investigation into Fox News journalist James Rosen was much wider than initially known. (Rosen was pursued in connection with a story he wrote about North Korea's nuclear program.) Quoting from court documents, Lizza writes that Ronald Machen, the US Attorney investigating the leak involving Rosen, seized the records for at least thirty different phone lines:
Two of the numbers begin with area code 202 and the exchange 456, which, according to current and former Administration officials, are used exclusively by the White House. (The phone number for the White House switchboard is (202) 456-1414.)
At least five other numbers targeted by the government include the area code 202 and the exchange 824. The phone number for the Fox News Washington bureau, which is publicly available, is (202) 824-0001. Rosen’s work phone number at Fox News begins with the same area code and exchange.
It is the second time in recent weeks that the DOJ has been found to have seized phone records as part of a leak investigation. The department, along with the Obama administration, has been met with stinging criticism for the zealousness and the scale of its probes. The scope of the Fox News subpoenas does not appear to have been as large as that of the DOJ's pursuit of the Associated Press. There, records for at least 20 phone lines were seized . Even so, the revelation will do nothing to weaken the belief of many journalists that the Obama administration has gone too far in its pursuit of leakers.

One of the most powerful tools in the arsenal of the grass roots food freedom fight is social media. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and many more networks allow people to instantly connect and provide a platform for information to be passed on exponentially. Facebook and Google are the two biggest websites in the entire world, and their reach is nearly unlimited.
Last week,  the Monsanto Company made it very clear that they were under the gun via social media , and they went on the defense, weakly claiming that those who object with their toxic seeds and deadly farming methods were “elitist,” thereby attempting to undermine us as snobbish people who don’t see the big picture and who don’t care about world hunger.
This week, they’ve upped their game. Mysterious things have been occurring on the social networks: posts have disappeared, some posts are hidden from the timelines of readers, and trolls abound on pages promoting this weekend’s  March Against Monsanto , happening worldwide on May 25.
Like any cornered rat, the leviathan seed company can see the very large threat coming their way, and it appears that they are pulling out all the stops to fight as dirty as they can. But the movement against the company is so powerful, that despite paid-off politicians and billions of dollars in the war chest, Monsanto knows that they’ve been outmatched. What we’re seeing now are the last, desperate attempts to keep the general public from learning about the man-made global disaster that was created by Monsanto.
On my own page, I found an interesting anomaly. I posted this yesterday:
My children’s first protest march!!!
Any ideas for our signs?
Everything you need to know and more about the March Against Monsanto. Don’t forget to subscribe to our email updates while you’re there:  http://bit.ly/106qja2

The thing that was very strange about this is that, at the bottom, you can see, it only got 67 views nearly 14 hours after I posted it. The posts that I shared above and below it all had hundreds of views. I asked some friends to check their timelines, and this particular post did not show up. They had to actually go to the page and look for it to find it tucked in near the bottom.
If I hadn’t heard from Tami Canal, the driving force behind the  March Against Monsanto’s Facebook page , I would have thought it was merely a fluke. But mysterious things have been happening there as well.
“Events are disappearing, posts are being put on city event pages that say events are cancelled. In no way, shape or form, has ANY event been cancelled. I believe Monsanto is behind this. Some of the people on the page that are commenting have newly made profiles and seemingly these profiles were made strictly to cause problems and get a rise out of our participants on the page.”
Monsanto has openly carried on an internet war with anti-GMO activists for years. Back in 2002, Jay Byrne, the former director of Monsanto’s Internet outreach, had some advice for colleagues:
“…’think of the Internet as a weapon on the table. Either you pick it up or your competitor does, but somebody is going to get killed.’
While he was working for Monsanto, Byrne told the internet newsletter Wow that he “spends his time and effort participating” in web discussions about biotech. He singled out the site AgBioWorld, where he “ensures his company gets proper play”. AgBioWorld is the site on which “Andura Smetacek” launched her campaign.
The biotech companies know that they will never conquer new markets while activists are able to expose the way their operations damage food security and consumer choice. ” ( source )
The Monsanto Company’s current overt tactics are to try and polish their very tarnished image by portraying themselves as do-gooders set on feeding the world, while painting anti-GMO protesters as uncaring, selfish individuals that haven’t given hungry Third World residents a passing thought. Less overt are these guerrilla internet shills, causing divisiveness in the movement by starting arguments on forums and in comment threads on social media, and outright passing on misinformation.
Unfortunately, Facebook seems to have the back of the trolls.  Occupy Monsanto ‘s page was actually  banned for three days when the owner publicly outed  an abusive PM from a troll. The person who wrote the letter faced no repercussions from Facebook. Other anti-GMO activists have announced that their posts have been hidden or otherwise censored, just like mine was.
Despite the rumors started that events for this Saturday’s March Against Monsanto have been cancelled, or that times have been changed, this is absolutely untrue. Canal reiterated, “In no way, shape or form, has ANY event been cancelled.” If you are planning to go to an event, rest assured, the events will go on as planned, despite the sneaky tactics of a desperate company.
Keep calm and don’t allow yourself to be provoked on Saturday. Anti-GMO activists are on the side of “good” in this battle, so it’s important to keep to the high road. Expect the presence of agent provocateurs, lots of law enforcement, and devious tactics to try to discredit the movement. The keys to successful resistance are unity, information, and public perception.
According to an article on  Natural Society , Monsanto has allied with the notorious mercenary security group, Blackwater (now known as  Academi ) in the fight against anti-GMO protesters:
Monsanto and Blackwater are indeed working together to target anti-Monsanto activists and organizations. Known as far back as 2010, it was unveiled that Blackwater’s client list included Monsanto, Chevron, Walt Disney and many more. According to  documents obtained by Scahill , it was also revealed that Monsanto was willing to pay upwards of $500,000 in order for Blackwater to join anti-Monsanto activist groups and infiltrate the ranks. Furthermore, a number of internet-based tactics could be utilized as incognito PR for Monsanto, who undoubtedly knew opposition would mount against their GMO crops as more individuals became aware of the dangers.
Don’t expect Monsanto to play fair. Tami Canal doesn’t.
“I’m not really surprised by Monsanto and their tactics….their bottom line is at stake and as they have demonstrated time and again, profit is their main objective at any expense, whether it be humanity or the environment. I encourage our participants to remain peaceful on Saturday. Do not let the paid shills entice you to violence. March Against Monsanto is a peaceful campaign and our voices will resonate much more loudly if we remain calm.”
Saturday promises to be one of the biggest worldwide protests that has ever taken place, with over two million people signed up to attend marches all over the globe. My children and I will absolutely be taking part in the historic event. Make a sign and join in – there is sure to be  a March near you !

By William Peacock, Esq. on March 20, 2013 11:50 AM
"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich." Sounds like two Guinnesses and something made out of chicken, doesn't it? It's making us hungry.
It's not food and drink, however. It's a complicated corporate tax loophole, exploited by tech companies and others with intellectual property, pioneered by Apple, and used by many to save billions of dollars in taxes.
It all begins with the licensing of patents and IP to an Irish subsidiary. When products are sold in the U.S., taxes are reduced by paying royalties to that subsidiary. Under Irish law, if the subsidiary is managed by foreigners, profits skip along, Irish tax-free, usually to a Caribbean tax haven.
When products are sold outside of the U.S., profits are directed to another Irish subsidiary, who forwards the profits to the Netherlands under a tax-free treaty, which kicks the profits back to the initial Irish subsidiary, which exploits the same foreign-manager tax loophole to send money to the Caribbean.
Confused yet? Here's a pretty diagram , courtesy of the New York Times.
(Apple's innovations go far beyond the iPhone, don't they?)
Your first question: Is this all legal? It better be, as a number of tech companies are doing it, including Amazon and Google , reports CNBC.
Then again, not all of them are succeeding. The problem comes down to the value of that intellectual property, or " transfer pricing ." How much is a patent worth? When a company is licensing patents to itself, it's going to be tempted to set the value to the amount that will best benefit itself tax-wise. (Higher valuation means larger business expense deduction.)
Instead, companies are supposed to determine prices at "arm's length", meaning whatever price would be appropriate if they weren't licensing to themselves.
Inappropriate transfer pricing does come back to haunt some companies. In December, the Internal Revenue Service went after Amazon for $234 million in back taxes , claiming over-valuation of IP. Of course, the IRS is not always successful. They famously lost a similar case against Veritas Software (now part of Symantec) in 2010.
With all of that said, should you advise your company to take the same route? The savings don't lie: One study estimates that Apple saved between $2.4 and $4.8 billion in taxes . Just be sure that your transfer pricing is reasonable. (And if you aren't a tax lawyer, it's time to consult outside counsel.)

Open-plan offices make employees less productive, less happy, and more likely to get sick
By Anna Codrea‑Rado — May 21, 2013
A well-designed office is a happy office. As facilities managers strive to save space and cash, they’re reshuffling desks and fiddling with temperature gauges. All of which has an impact on workers’ performance. Open-plan offices may make some kinds of collaboration easier, but are they more conducive to productivity? What’s the most irritating workplace distraction? And are those state-of-the-art workstations actually more comfortable? Here’s the Quartz complete guide to open-plan offices:
Nearly three quarters of Americans work in open-plan offices
According to the International Management Facility Association, 70% of American employees work in open-plan offices.
The world’s largest open-plan office
Mark Zuckerberg  hired Frank Gehry to design Facebook’s office expansion  in Menlo Park in California. Once completed—its planning application has been approved and work is set to start imminently—the social network’s new digs will be the world’s largest open-plan office.
Workers in open-plan offices get sick more often
Workers who  share an office take more sick days  than those who work in their own closed spaces. A study in the Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health found that open office setups reported 62% more sick days on average than one-occupant layouts. It was the first national population study conducted in Denmark to find such a linkage. One suggested explanation, unsurprisingly, was that viruses and bacteria spread more easily in open offices. Another was that open offices are more stressful to work in because of the lack of privacy, and that the stress makes sickness more likely.
Workers don’t like noise
Researchers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University wanted to study which aspects of office design had the biggest impact on workers’ productivity.  CK Mak and YP Lui  questioned 259 office workers about the importance of sound, temperature, office layout, air quality and lighting for productivity; they found that sound and temperature mattered the most. The most irritating noises were conversations, ringing phones and machines.
Older workers really don’t like noise
Mak and Lui also found that the environment mattered least to the younger participants in their study. Those over 45 were more sensitive to it, and factors like noise and temperature had a bigger effect on their productivity.
Open-plan offices are less productive
In a literature review of studies on open-plan offices, researchers from Virginia State University and North Carolina State University found evidence to suggest that they’re linked to lower productivity. Scanning work from the Journal of Human Ecology, Academy of Management Journal and Administrative Science Quarterly, Tonya Smith-Jackson and Katherine Klein identified reduced motivation, decreased job satisfaction and lower perceived privacy as factors negatively affecting productivity in open-plan environments. Similar to Mak and Lui findings, the resounding message in the research is that overhearing conversations in the office is very intrusive and distracting for workers.
Making offices open-plan isn’t a popular move
People work less well when they move from a personal office to an open-plan layout, according to a longitudinal study carried out by Calgary University. Writing in the  Journal of Environment and Behavior , Aoife Brennan, Jasdeep Chugh and Theresa Kline found that such workers reported more stress, less satisfaction with their environment and less productivity. Brennan et al went back to survey the participants six months after the move and found not only that they were still unhappy with their new office, but that their team relations had broken down even further.
Fancy workstations don’t make much difference
Cornell researcher Alan Hedge wanted to find out what happened if offices provided employees with smaller, ergonomically designed desks. He concluded that they couldn’t be relied on as a space-saver because the workers couldn’t figure how to use them. Workers in the study were split down the middle as to whether the specially designed workstations were more comfortable and easier to work at than traditional (and larger) alternatives. Hedge did find that the employees who had been trained to use their equipment were more comfortable and productive than those who hadn’t. Turns out “ergonomic” doesn’t equate to “intuitive”.
Bad office conditions cost employers two and a half days a year
Writing in the Journal of Facilities Management, Dutch researcher Paul Roelofsen examined the  effect of comfort levels in offices on productivity . Roelofsen knew from previous research that poor office conditions were causing absenteeism among Dutch employees. A survey of 7,000 Dutch workers found that they were absent for 2.5 days a year on average because of complaints about their office environment, most commonly related to temperature. Roelofsen also noted in his work that even among the workers who are present, if the environment isn’t ideal for them they won’t work as hard. He estimated that quality improvements yield between a 5% and 15% increase in productivity.

In his cubicle at Intel headquarters, Paul Otellini shows a chip-circuitry diagram that is stitched into the lining of his sportcoat. (Alexis Madrigal)
Forty-five years after Intel was founded by Silicon Valley legends Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce, it is the world's leading semiconductor company. While almost every similar company -- and there used to be many -- has disappeared or withered away, Intel has thrived through the rise of Microsoft, the Internet boom and the Internet bust, the resurgence of Apple, the laptop explosion that eroded the desktop market, and the wholesale restructuring of the semiconductor industry.
For 40 of those years, a timespan that saw computing go from curiosity to ubiquity, Paul Otellini has been at Intel. He's been CEO of the company for the last eight years, but close to the levers of power since he became then-CEO Andy Grove's de facto chief of staff in 1989. Today is Otellini's last day at Intel. As soon as he steps down at a company shareholder meeting, Brian Krzanich, who has been with the company since 1982, will move up from COO to become Intel's sixth CEO.
It's almost certain that the chorus of goodbyes for Otellini will underestimate his accomplishments as the head of the world's foremost chipmaker. He's a company man who is not much of a rhetorician, and the last few quarters of declining revenue and income have brought out detractors. They'll say Otellini did not  get Intel's chips into smartphones and tablets , leaving the company locked out of computing's fastest growing market. They'll say Intel's risky, capital-intensive, vertically integrated business model doesn't belong in the new semiconductor industry , and that the loose coalition built around ARM's phone-friendly chip architecture have bypassed the once-invincible Intel along with its old WinTel friends, Microsoft, Dell, and HP. 
Intel generated more revenue during Otellini's 8-year tenure than it did during the rest of the company's 45-year history.
And yet, consider the case for Otellini . Intel generated more revenue during his eight-year tenure as CEO than it did during the rest of the company's 45-year history. If it weren't for the Internet bubble-inflated earnings of the year 2000, Otellini would have presided over the generation of greater profits than his predecessors combined as well. As it is, the company machinery under him spun off $66 billion in profit (i.e. net income), as compared with the $68 billion posted by his predecessors. The $11 billion Intel earned in 2012 easily beats the sum total ($9.5) posted by Qualcomm ($6.1), Texas Instruments ($1.8), Broadcom ($0.72), Nvidia ($0.56), and Marvel ($0.31), not to mention its old rival AMD, which lost more than a billion dollars. 
Of course, Otellini has both his predecessors' ambition and inflation to thank for his gaudy numbers, but he kept Intel a powerhouse. Under his watch since 2005, it created the world's best chips for laptops, assumed a dominant position in the server market, vanquished long-time rival AMD, retained a vertically integrated business model that's unique in the industry, and maintained profitability throughout the global economic meltdown. The company he ran was far larger, more complex and more global than anything Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore could have imagined when they founded it in 1968. And the business environment was certainly no easier than any encountered by the other four Intel CEOs. Yet he delivered quarter after quarter of profits along increasing revenue. In the last full year before he ascended to chief executive, Intel generated $34 billion in sales. By 2012, that number had grown to $53 billion.
"By all accounts, the company has been incredibly successful during his tenure on the things that made them Intel," said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst who covers the semiconductor industry at Sanford C. Bernstein. "Tuning the machine that is Intel happened very well under his watch. They've grown revenues a ton and margins are higher than they used to be."
Even Otellini's natural rival, former AMD CEO Hector Ruiz, had to agree that Intel's CEO "was more successful than people give him credit for."
But, oh, what could have been! Even Otellini betrayed a profound sense of disappointment over a decision he made about a then-unreleased product that became the iPhone. Shortly after winning Apple's Mac business , he decided against doing what it took to be the chip in Apple's paradigm-shifting product. 
"We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it," Otellini told me in a two-hour conversation during his last month at Intel. "The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do... At the end of the day, there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought."
It was the only moment I heard regret slip into Otellini's voice during the several hours of conversations I had with him. "The lesson I took away from that was, while we like to speak with data around here, so many times in my career I've ended up making decisions with my gut, and I should have followed my gut," he said. "My gut told me to say yes."
"My gut told me to say yes" to the iPhone.
In person, Otellini is forthright and charming. For a lifelong business guy, his affect is educator, not salesman. He is the kind of guy who would recommend that a junior colleague read a book like Scale and Scope, a 780-page history of industrial capitalism. To his credit, he fired back responses to nearly all my questions about his tenure, company, and industry at a dinner during CES in Las Vegas and later at Intel's headquarters. And when he wasn't going to answer, he didn't duck, but repelled: "I'm not going to talk about that."
On stage, however, during the heavily produced keynote talks CEOs are now required to give, Otellini's persona and company do not inspire legions of cheering fans. When he steps on stage, there is no Jobsian swell of emotion, no one screams out, "We love you, Paul!" And yet, this is the outfit that pushes the leading edge of chip innovation. They are the keepers of (Gordon) Moore's Law, ensuring that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit continues to double every couple years or so. If Otellini's CV is lacking a driverless car project or rocketship company, it may be because the technical challenges Intel faces require a different kind of corporation and leader.
"He's super low-key guy. He's not a Steve Jobs. He's not a Bill Gates. But his contribution has been just as big," said the new president of Intel, Renee James, who has worked with Otellini for 15 years.
His management secret was his own exemplary drive, discipline, and humility. He came in early, worked hard, and demanded excellence of himself. "He didn't yell and scream. He never dictated. He never asked me to come in on a Sunday. He never asked me to stay late on a Friday. But he had this way of getting you to rise to the occasion," said Navin Shenoy, who served as Otellini's chief-of-staff from 2004 to 2007. "He'd challenge you to do something that we'd all be proud of."
Peter Thiel might complain that the Valley hasn't invented rocket packs and flying car because investors and entrepreneurs have been focused on frivolous nonsense. But Paul Otellini's Intel spent $19.5 billion on R&D during 2011 and 2012. That's $8 billion more than Google. And a substantial amount of Intel's innovation comes from its manufacturing operations, and Intel spent another $20 billion building factories during the last two years. That's nearly $40 billion dedicated to bringing new products into being in just two years! These investments have continued because of Otellini's unshakeable faith that eventually, as he told me, "At the end of the day, the best transistors win, no matter what you're building, a server or a phone." That's always the strategy. That's always the solution.
"At the end of the day, the best transistors win, no matter what you're building, a server or a phone."
Intel's kind of business and Otellini's brand of competent, quiet management are not in fashion in Silicon Valley right now. And yet, almost no one has can claim the Valley more than Otellini. Every day for four decades -- in a career that spans the entirety of the PC era -- Intel's Santa Clara headquarters have been the center of his working world.
As we stood outside Otellini's corner cubicle, marked by a makeshift waiting room with a television, a couple of display cases, and a plucky plant, I asked him to reflect on what the end might feel like. "It is strange. I've been pinning this badge on every day for 40 years," he said. "But I won't miss the commute from San Francisco." After making thousands of trips down 101 and racking up 1.2 million miles on United through hundreds of trips around the world, he seemed ready to stop going.
The "hallway" to Otellini's "corner office."
The Many Computer Revolutions
Despite the $53 billion in revenue and all the company's technical and business successes, the question on many a commentator's mind is, Can Intel thrive in the tablet and smartphone world the way it did during the standard PC era?
The industry changes ushered in by the surge in these flat-glass computing devices can be seen two ways. Intel's James prefers to see the continuities with Intel's existing business. "Everyone wants the tablet to be some mysterious thing that's killing the PC. What do you think the tablet really is? A PC," she said. "A PC by any other name is still a personal computer. If it does general purpose computing with multiple applications, it's a PC." Sure, she admitted, tablets are a "form factor and user modality change," but tablets are still "a general purpose computer."
On the other hand, the industry changes that have surrounded the great tablet upheaval have been substantial. Consumer dollars are flowing to different places. Instead of Microsoft's operating system dominating, Apple and Google's do. The old-line PC makers have struggled, while relative upstarts such as Samsung and Amazon have pushed millions of units.
The chip challenges are different as well. Rather than optimizing for the maximum computational power of a device, it's energy efficiency that's most important. How much performance can a processor deliver per watt of power it sucks from a too-small battery?
The semiconductor industry itself has seen perhaps even larger changes. In the early days of Silicon Valley, chipmakers had their foundries right there in the Valley, hence the name. During the 1980s, Japanese chipmakers battled American ones, beating them badly until Intel turned the tide in the latter half of the decade. The factories moved out of the valley to places like domesticallyChandler, Arizona and Folsom, California, as well as to Asia, mostly Taiwan.
Meanwhile, each generation of chips got technically more challenging and the foundries required to build them got more expensive. Chipmakers needed to sell massive amounts of chips in order to make up the huge capital equipment costs. The industry became cruelly cyclical, booming and busting with a regularity that defied managerial skill. For all those reasons and more, during the last twenty years, the chipmaking industry has been consolidating. Almost all semiconductor companies are now "fabless," choosing to outsource the production of their silicon to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), or GlobalFoundries, a venture backed by the United Arab Emirates. The new fabless chip designers don't have to build plants, which allows them to have more stable businesses, but they lose the ability to gain competitive advantage by tweaking production lines. The transition to this state of affairs killed off many companies and allowed others to thrive.
Add it all up and there are only a few chipmakers left standing. The aforementioned contract manufacturers like TSMC, Samsung, and, of course, Intel.
These two structural trends at the consumer and industry levels intersect at a formerly obscure British company called ARM Holdings . Originally founded as a partnership between Acorn Computers (remember them?), VLSI (remember them?), and Apple, ARM now just creates and licenses the chip architectures that other companies tweak and have manufactured. In a sense, they sell a chip "starter kit" that companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Marvel, and Nvidia build upon to create their own products. 
Chips based on the ARM intellectual property are generally not as high-performance as Intel's, but they're fantastically energy efficient. While ARM did make chips for Apple's ill-fated Newton device, in the early 2000s, ARM became the dominant architecture supplier to the so-called "embedded" market.  These chips are not general computing devices, but have specific jobs in (for example) cars, hard drives, and factories. This specialization is also one of the reasons that ARM chips are cheap. An Intel microprocessor could sell for $100. ARM-based chips might sell for $10, and often less than a dollar. In the first quarter of this year, 2.6 billion chips using ARM's architecture were shipped.
The two key attributes of ARM's architecture -- energy efficiency and low cost -- developed before cell phone phones, but they were exactly what mobile designers were looking for. As the smartphone market exploded, so did ARM's share price as investors realized what a key node ARM had become in the burgeoning computer-on-glass phone and tablet market.
As the smartphone market exploded, so did ARM's share price.
For companies who are trying to decide whether to go with Intel or an ARM-licensee, it's a bit like being asked whether you'd rather deal with Switzerland or the Aztec empire. "With ARM, when you are tired of Qualcomm you can go to NVIDIA or another company," Linley Gwennap, the boss of the Linley Group, a research firm, told The Economist last year . "But in Intel's case, there's nobody else on its team."
ARM-based designs are now found in more than 95 percent of smartphones. ARM may not be dominant in the way Intel is dominant in PCs, but the system it underpins is.
Simon Segars is the man who will have to deal with the fallout from all of ARM's successes. He begins as the new CEO of the company on July 1. I met him after he spoke on a panel about "multi-industry business ecosystems" at the Parc 55 hotel in the heart of San Francisco. He was tall and genial, happy to patiently and thoroughly explain why ARM had found itself in possession of so many friends and so much good fortune.
"I can genuinely say that our approach is to work within an ecosystem that is a healthy ecosystem. By that I mean the people in it are making money from what they do," he said. "We get questions on a regular basis, Why don't you quadruple your royalty rates? Because you're so strong, what are you customers going to do? We could do that and we could probably enjoy some more revenue for some time, but our customers would go off and do something else or have less healthy businesses. If we tried to extract lots of money out of the ecosystem, we'd have less companies supporting the ARM architecture and that would limit where it could go."
ARM is a company that finds itself in the right place at the right time with a philosophy of innovation that lots of companies want to believe in.
"Through the '90s and early 2000s, we saw an explosion in the number of people who could build a chip. That led to a lot of innovation and all the electronic devices that we see today," Segars said. "The role we've played is providing this core building block, this microprocessor, that many of these devices require. We've provided that in a very cost-effective way to anybody who wanted it. And that's allowed people to put intelligence into devices that they couldn't have afforded to do because they would have had to do it all themselves."
The Mobile Mystery: What Did Otellini See and When Did He See It?
Many of the structural changes that occurred in these industries now seem predictable. It feels like somebody else could have positioned Intel differently to take advantage of these trends. At the very least, Otellini should have seen where the changes were leading the silicon world.
And the thing is, he did. He just wasn't able to get the Intel machine turning fast enough. "The explosion of low-end devices, we kinda saw as a company and for a variety of reasons weren't able to get our arms around it early enough," he admitted.
It was Otellini, after all, who had made the call to start developing the very successful low-power Atom processor for mobile computing applications. And it was Otellini, who upon ascending to the throne, drew a diagram that I'll call the Otellini Corollary to Moore's Law at the company's annual Strategic Long Range Planning Process meeting, or SLRP. He duplicated it for me in an appropriately anonymous Intel conference room, calling it half-jokingly "the history of the computer industry in one chart."
On the Y-axis, we have the number of units sold in a year. On the X-axis, we have the price of the device, beginning with the $10,000 IBM PC at the far left and extending to $100 on the far right. Then, he drew a diagonal line bisecting the axes. As Otellini sketched, he talked through the movements represented in the chart. "By the time the price got to $1000, sort of in the mid-90s, the industry got to 100 million units a year," he said, circling the $1k. "And as PCs continued to come down in price, they got to be an average price of 600 or 700 dollars and we got up to 300 million units." He traced the line up to his diagonal line and drew an arrow pointing to a dot on the line. "You are here," he said. "I don't mean just phones, but mainstream computing is a billion units at $100. That's where we're headed."
"What I told our guys is that we rode all the way up through here, but what we needed to do was very different to get to [a billion units]... You have to be able to build chips for $10 and sell a lot of them."
"This is what I had to draw to get Intel to start thinking about ultracheap," Otellini concluded.
"How well do you think Intel is thinking about ultracheap?" I asked.
"Oh they got it now," he said, to the laughter of the press relations crew with us. "I did this in '05, so it's [been more than] seven years now. They got it as of about two years ago. Everybody in the company has got it now, but it took a while to move the machine."
It took a while to move the machine. The problem, really, was that Intel's x86 chip architecture could not rival the performance per watt of power that designs licensed from ARM based on RISC architecture could provide. Intel was always the undisputed champion of performance, but its chips sucked up too much power. In fact, it was  only this month that Intel revealed chips  that seem like they'll be able to beat the ARM licensees on the key metrics.
No one can quite understand why it's taken so long. "I think Intel is still suffering with the inability of this very fine company to enter a new major segment that changes the game," Magnus Hyde, former head of TSMC North America told me. "That's been a problem before Paul, been a problem during Paul, and will probably be a problem going forward. They have all the things they need on the paper: the know-how, the customers, the cash to take over whatever they need. But somehow a little piece is missing."
"This is a company with 100,000 employees with a 40-year legacy. They are unbelievably good at what they do. No one can touch them," said Rasgon, the analyst. "There is a certain degree of arrogance that goes align with that."
"As CEO, that's your job: steer [the ship]," he continued. "It doesn't necessary mean [Otellini had] a failure of vision, but he couldn't get the ship to turn."
Ruiz, who led AMD's last battle with Intel while he was CEO from 2002 to 2008, told me he thought Intel's mobile progress had been slowed by their concentration on his company. "The focus the company has had for the past three decades on squashing AMD caused them to lose sight of the important trends towards mobility and low power," he said. "They should have focused more on their customers and the future than on trying to outdo AMD."
Some people seem to think someone else could have done better. And it's nice to believe in the transformative leader. Call it the Fire-the-Coach Fallacy. Sometimes, installing a new leader of an organization leads to better performance. But far more often, as some simple Freakonomics blogpost would tell you, we overestimate  the importance of changing the coach or the CEO . It's not that CEOs are not important, but the preexisting conditions within and surrounding a company are just more important.
Unlike a lot of leaders, Otellini seems aware of this fact. "Intel's culture is blessedly not the culture of a CEO, nor has it ever been," he told me. "It's the Intel culture."
Otellini, of course, knew the Intel culture well. It had formed the substrate of his entire career. Starting out in finance in 1974, he'd worked his way up the chain on the business side of the operation, eventually landing the key gig of managing Intel's IBM account in 1983. It was right before Intel abandoned the memory business. He'd worked closely with Andy Grove, watching how he processed information, managed, and made decisions. He'd spent two years in the executive suite with Craig Barrett, watching him steer Intel in the rocky days after the Internet bust.
The Intel culture has been remarkably successful, of course. But it has also shown a resistance to change. It has managed to successfully surf massive transitions like getting out of the memory business in 1985 to focus on microprocessors and retaining a leading position in the move from desktop processors to laptops, but the same focus and scale that make Intel so powerful also prevent it from changing tacks quickly. If you've got 4,000 PhDs and 96,000 other people working for you, it's hard to turn on a dime.
Perhaps, though, the transformation that Otellini began in 2005 will finally be complete during Brian Krzanich's tenure. Intel's technical lead, perfectionism, and scale will create amazing chips at prices that cause phone and tablet makers to give up their commitments to the ARM ecosystem.
"They already have products in the marketplace that are competitive and I would not be surprised if they had best-in-class products in a few years," Rasgon said. "What they are doing on the [manufacturing] process has really driven that."
Otellini sees an analogy to the current situation in Intel's performance with Centrino laptop chips. "Intel made the big bet. [Chief Product Officer] Dadi [Perlmutter] and I made the big bet in 2001 to bet on mobile. This was when the desktop was 80 percent of all PCs, maybe 90 percent, and unabated growth and notebooks were luggables," Otellini said. "And we thought that there was an argument about what a computer could be and that led to what would become Centrino."
Centrino chips won over Apple's Steve Jobs because the silicon was so good they could not be ignored. "The head-to-head of comparison of an Intel based notebook and an Apple notebook were night and day in terms of performance, battery life, etc," he said. "That's what got their attention."
And if Apple -- so notoriously anti-Intel that a 1996 Mac commercial showed a burning Intel mascot -- could come to love Intel processors, couldn't all the current ARM licensees see the blue Intel light?
A Battle of Innovation Cultures: The Lab Vs. The Ecosystem
The cover image of Intel's 1983 history of itself, " A Revolution in Progress ."
Silicon Valley has been, rightly or wrongly, synonymous with innovation for four decades. Now, it's as much a notion as a place. When Paul Otellini joined Intel in 1974, a year of bloodletting at the company that also saw two of its future CEOs hired (Otellini and his predecessor Craig Barrett), the peninsula south of San Francisco and the Santa Clara Valley had merged in the American mind into the crucible for the future. Though Intel would only make $20 million that year, it was clear that these chips, and their tendency to get cheaper so quickly, were a new force unto the world. The whole enterprise was shaped by individual humans , structured by capitalism , and aided by Cold War R&D money , but the effects of all this memory and computation, its exponentiality, were hard to predict. A story led the New York Times business section a couple years later with the banner headline, " Revolution in Silicon Valley ." The subheadline read, "'The basic thing that drives technology is the desire to make money,' says one executive. Now, where can they use the technology?" 
Think of that as a kind of ur-mainstream media Silicon Valley story. It's got all the elements: an early reference to the orchards that used to exist, "low-slung" buildings as the unlikely seat of revolution, hot consumer products, hypercompetitive industries, massive innovation, great men, something like a formulation of Moore's Law, and the exceptionalist sense that this could only happen in this one place in California. 
There are two conflicting narratives about all this Silicon Valley innovation. On the one hand, there is the notion that Silicon Valley is an ecosystem of entrepreneurs and inventors, financiers and researchers. Companies can break up and reassemble. Spinoffs can pop out of larger corporations. Startups can disrupt whole industries. Competitors can cooperate and then compete and then cooperate. And when you add up all these risk-taking, failure-forgiving people, the sum is greater than the parts. Fundamental to this notion is the idea that innovation happens best in networks of firms and individuals, in an ecosystem (a word that itself gained credence thanks, in part, to Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich in the late 1960s). 
The ARM biosphere, from the cover of the company's 2009 annual report (ARM).
On the other hand, we have Intel. Intel structured and thought of itself like a research laboratory, according to long-time Silicon Valley journalist Michael S. Malone, in his 1985 book, The Big Score. "The image of a giant research team is important to understanding the corporate philosophy Intel developed for itself," Malone wrote. "On a research team, everybody is an equal, from the project director right down to the person who cleans the floors: each contributes his or her expertise toward achieving the final goal of a finished successful product."
From Intel's 1984 annual report (Intel)
Malone went on that the culture of Intel was not that of a bunch of loosey-goosey risk takers, but true believers, almost robotic in their dedication to Intel's goals. "Intel was in many ways a camp for bright young people with unlimited energy and limited perspective," he continued. "That's one of the reasons Intel recruited most of its new hires right out of college: they didn't want the kids polluted by corporate life... There was also the belief, the infinite, heartrending belief most often found in young people, that the organization to which they've attached themselves is the greatest of its kind in the world; the conviction they are part of a team of like-minded souls pushing back the powers of darkness in the name of all mankind."
This is a very different vision of innovation. This is an army of people tightly coordinated, highly organized, and hardened by faith. It was this side that competitors and suppliers have long encountered and complained about (sometimes appealing to the regulatory authorities).
"They are tough to deal with. I know some of the executives privately and they say, 'We're not really nice people to deal with.' They admit it. And it's true," Magnus Hyde, former head of Taiwan Semiconductor North America, told me. "They are really nasty when you get into negotiations."
And as for this whole "failure's cool!" mantra that seems to re-echo around Silicon Valley, Intel's Andy Grove enshrined what he called " creative confrontation ," which encouraged and rewarded people to get after each other for flagging performance or mistakes. 
The cover of Intel's 1982 annual report (Intel).
Taken as a whole, Intel is a self-contained research, development, and deployment machine. That is not an ecosystem. Though obviously Intel has many partners with whom it makes money and has good relationships, on the leading edge of innovation, Intel goes it alone. 
Time and again, this strategy has worked as almost all of their competitors have fallen by the wayside. Intel is the only chip company in the world that's been able to hang on to its vertically integrated business model. "They have these methods, these Intel methods, that have worked very well for them," Hyde said.
The way Otellini vanquished AMD is a classic example of the Intel way. AMD had always played Brooklyn to Intel's Manhattan. Otellini himself had offers from both companies coming out of business school, and the competition remained fierce all the way until he took the reins. AMD was resurgent then. They had beat Intel to market with excellent 64-bit chips that were perceived to provide more performance for less money than Intel's processors. AMD's stock was on a climb that would take it to dizzying heights. By the end of 2008, Intel had destroyed AMD's momentum and sent the company into a tailspin. Finally, in early 2009, AMD spun out its fabrication facilities, exiting the chipmaking game. It was TKO in the longest-running bout in Silicon Valley. "They buried AMD," Rasgon put it bluntly.
Of course, there were several ugly court battles about Intel's hardball tactics in keeping AMD out of more machines. Intel eventually paid AMD $1.25 billion to settle the case in late 2009.
What's clear is that when Intel has a single competitor to focus on, they are hard to beat. "The thing about Intel is that we always come back," Otellini told me. "We put resources on it. We get focused. And watch out." They outinnovate, outmanufacture, and outcompete any company that comes into their targets. 
Which brings us back to the question of mobile, the space that has eluded Intel for a decade. What's fascinating is that it's a battle between Intel and a swarm of companies licensing chip designs from a relatively small IP company, ARM. Intel has bulk and strength, but they've come up against that other model of innovation: the ecosystem. It's two ideas about how Silicon Valley works locked in combat. If you're the swarm, with Qualcomm as the queen bee, the question is: How do you hold the coalition together? 
If you're Intel, which fly do you fire the shotgun at? Not ARM, that's for sure.
"ARM is an architecture. It's a licensing company," Otellini said. "If I wanted to compete with ARM, I'd say let's license Intel architecture out to anyone that wants it and have at it and we'll make our money on royalties. And we'd be about a third the size of the company."
"It's important for me, as the CEO, that I tell our employees who it is that we have to compete with and who we're focused on, and I don't want them focused on ARM. I want them focused on Qualcomm or Nvidia or TI," he continued. "Or if someone like Apple is using ARM to build a phone chip, I want our guys focused on building the best chip for Apple, so they want to buy our stuff."
I asked ARM's Segars about what I'd heard from Otellini, namely that Intel would beat the individual members of his coalition because they make the best transistors, and that would ultimately carry the day.
"There is a long track record of Intel investing very heavily on the leading edge of technology and implementing innovations of process technologies ahead of everybody else. That is a statement of fact and nobody would dispute that," Segars responded. "The transistors are, of course, important. The way in which the transistors are used is very important and really what the explosion of the technology space over the last couple of decades has shown is that there is a need to innovate and you can't focus innovation in just one company. If all the world's chips came from one vendor, whether it's Intel or anybody else, naturally that's going to limit innovation because there are only so many people and there will be a philosophy that's followed."
But Otellini, or Krzanich, can't focus Intel on ARM's "intangible" rhetoric. The questions industry watchers should be asking, Otellini said, are these ones: "Do you think Intel can beat Qualcomm? Do you think Intel can beat Nvidia? Do you think Intel can compete with Samsung?" 
The answer might be yes, Intel can compete with each one, but maybe not with them all. 
Or, maybe, the great machine will dominate once again. That's how Stacey Rasgon, the analyst who's been watching Intel and its rival chipmakers for two decades, sees it: "If I'm looking out five, ten years, they could potentially bury everybody else."

Learning From Los Gatos
Why Silicon Valley is not the second coming of the Gilded Age.
It’s no surprise that George Packer—one of the most gifted writers in the business—has hit upon a fascinating topic in his latest New Yorker piece : the emerging politics of Silicon Valley. While the essay is behind a paywall, it’s definitely worth tracking down if you’re not a subscriber. (Also, hey, it’s The New Yorker — you should be a subscriber!) But for all the richness of the subject matter, in this case I think Packer has failed to capture the complexities of the Silicon Valley scene, in part because he’s using older conceptual frames that don’t adequately explain the phenomena he’s observing.
There is much of Silicon Valley that warrants criticism: the mono-culture now threatening San Francisco’s storied diversity and general weirdness; the anonymous office park sprawl of its built spaces; the male-dominated engineering culture; its assumption that all disruptions are good ones by definition; its casual scorn for older institutions. Packer has appropriately cutting words—and anecdotes—for most of these flaws in his piece. But his two main criticisms—the “prevailing” politics of the Valley and its economic inequality—miss their marks, for slightly different reasons.
The first assumption, cited half a dozen times in the piece, is that the default political framework of the Valley is libertarian. When I was writing Future Perfect —which makes a cameo in Packer’s piece—I spent quite a few pages clarifying that while the new “peer progressive” worldview shared some superficial characteristics with Randian libertarianism, it was in actuality fundamentally different. Yes, people who work in the tech sector today (particularly around the web and social media) believe in the power of decentralized systems and less hierarchical forms of organization. But that does not mean they are greed-is-good market fundamentalists. For starters, almost all of them recognize that their industry itself arose out of government funding (see ARPANET), and some of the most celebrated achievements of the digital culture (open source software, Wikipedia) involve commons-based collaboration with no conventional definition of private property whatsoever. It’s precisely because we lack a new vocabulary to describe this worldview that we end up lumping the tech sector together in the libertarian camp.
You can see this confusion most clearly in a series of datapoints that go amazingly unmentioned in Packer’s piece: namely, the election returns from last fall’s presidential race. As Nate Silver observed in a detailed postmortem on Northern California votes, Obama won Santa Clara county by 42% — more than ten times his margin nationally, and more than twice his margin in the rest of liberal California. (While San Francisco and Oakland have long been hotbeds of progressivism, Reagan won Santa Clara by double digits in both of his successful campaigns.) You would think such a dramatic swing to the left would at least warrant a mention in Packer’s piece, but from reading it, an outsider might reasonably assume that the Valley was a Republican stronghold—a vast army of Koch brothers with hoodies.
The numbers are even more stark when you look at campaign finance. According to Silver’s analysis, Google employees gave more than 97% of their political donations to Obama, with comparable percentages at Apple and eBay as well. If libertarianism is so rampant in Silicon Valley, why are they voting for higher taxes and funding a big government liberal by such overwhelming numbers?
By focusing so much on the libertarian framework, Packer buries (or indeed doesn’t even bother to mention) the lede, which is the stunning advantage that Democrats now have among the rising information classes. The most dynamic sector of the global capitalist economy is now decisively in the camp of the Democrats. How could this somehow go unmentioned in a piece about politics in Silicon Valley? The consequences of this shift are likely to be profound and multifaceted ones. (Silver mentions just one: “Since Democrats had the support of 80 percent or 90 percent of the best and brightest minds in the information technology field, it shouldn’t be surprising that Mr. Obama’s information technology infrastructure was viewed as state-of-the-art exemplary, whereas everyone from Republican volunteers to Silicon Valley journalists have criticized Mr. Romney’s systems .”) The interesting question about the Valley is how it reconciles its fondness for decentralized networks with its progressive political values. I’ve tried to answer that question by proposing the new category of peer progressivism, but whether you buy that answer or not, Packer doesn’t even bother to ask the question.
Then there’s the issue of inequality, which is where Packer starts, observing the rise of homelessness and the staggering cost of real estate in the area. No doubt about it, the explosive rise in wealth and income inequality in the U.S. may well be the single most pressing problem that we face, the slow but steady reversal of the last century’s rising tide. Packer deserves serious props for shining a light on that disturbing trend. But here again, I think he gets the Silicon Valley part of the story wrong, even if his motives are in the right place. Early in the piece, he cites a telling statistic: “There are fifty or so billionaires and tens of thousands of millionaires in Silicon Valley.” Think about that for a second: tens of thousands of millionaires, almost all them created by companies that didn’t exist two decades ago.
Why did that happen? Sure, companies went public or sold for staggering sums, but companies have been going public or selling out for generations without creating tens of thousands of millionaires along the way. The defining difference between Silicon Valley companies and almost every other industry in the U.S. is the virtually universal practice among tech companies of distributing meaningful equity (usually in the form of stock options) to ordinary employees. Before companies like Fairchild and Hewlett-Packard began the practice fifty years ago, distributing stock options to anyone other than top management was virtually unheard of. But the engineering tradition that spawned Silicon Valley was much more egalitarian than traditional corporate culture.
There’s a great book on this topic, called In The Company Of Owners, that documents just how distinct the Valley is from the rest of U.S. corporate culture. The top 100 tech companies granted 19% of their total ownership to non-senior-executive employees (i.e., everyone excluding the CEO and four lieutenants.) For the rest of corporate America, that number was 2%. In other words, when it came time to share rewards with ordinary employees, the Tech 100 were ten times more generous than low-tech firms. This is actually one of the hidden strengths of the tech sector in the US: its companies are much more competitive precisely because they are much more egalitarian in how they share their wealth internally. I would be surprised if there were any new industry in the history of capitalism that distributed its economic rewards to its employees as widely as Silicon Valley has. Billionaire founders or CEOs are nothing new. But multi-millionaire middle-managers? That’s something else altogether.
This is the paradox that Packer elides with his New Gilded Age narrative. The real estate crunch in Silicon Valley ultimately stems from the fact that there are tens of thousands of people living there who can afford to pay five million dollars for a house. Sure, a small elite of younger, hipper billionaire magnates are out there building their own San Simeons. But that’s a California story almost as old as the Gold Rush. What’s different now is that there’s a whole class of software engineers or a designers who can drop seven figures on an unrenovated fifties ranch house. There’s a real estate crisis in Silicon Valley because the companies in the region are much more generous in the way they share the wealth, not less.
Of course, the fact that Silicon Valley companies are more egalitarian than their equivalents in other industries doesn’t help us with the wider problem of inequality. Not everyone can work for Google, and in general, tech sector companies employ fewer Americans than their industrial predecessors. And all those middle-management millionaires make it harder for everyone else to live in the the same region, particularly where real estate values are concerned. For Packer, the lesson seems to be: the excesses of the digital-era super rich give us a case study in the growing problem of inequality throughout the U.S.. But you could reasonably draw the exact opposite lesson: that one way to deal with rising inequality is to make the rest of corporate America act more like Silicon Valley.
There is a growing body of research that shows that companies that limit their high-low wage ratios and distribute generous option plans consistently outperform more traditional, inegalitarian firms. Companies that flatten hierarchies and distribute rewards more fairly are actually more profitable, and not just nicer places to work. They don’t need high-flying IPOs to do this; simply flattening the ratio of executive-to-average-worker-pay creates similar benefits. The movement towards these more egalitarian corporate structures goes by many names: “stakeholder” or “partner” or even “conscious” capitalism. (In Future Perfect, I talk about this as one of the tenets of peer progressivism.) But whatever you call it, the framework has clearly generated its most spectacular results in Silicon Valley.
The whole premise of stakeholder capitalism offers a powerful and distinct message, because it gets at both our desire to be competitive in the global marketplace, but also to be more fair and equitable in the way we share our wealth. True libertarians would be repulsed at the thought, but the success of Silicon Valley even suggests that governments could do much more to encourage these kinds of internal compensation structures, in the name of better business and social cohesion. (Not to mention old-fashioned fairness.)
But to even think about those possibilities, you have to start with the idea that the wealth creation in Silicon Valley might have the seeds of something progressive in it, which Packer seems unwilling to do, unfortunately. The rise of a libertarian geek oligarchy is an easier story to tell, to be sure. But it’s not the most interesting one.

 Text Size    
 Published: Tuesday, 21 May 2013 | 12:48  PM ET
By: Michael Strong, CNBC Contributor
With his company's stock surging, Tesla Motors CEO expects to use the potentially $1 billion windfall from a new stock offering to both pay off the maker's $465 million in Department of Energy loans—and to help fund additional products needed to help the California battery-car maker expand.
Source: Teslamotors.com
Tesla Motors S Model
CEO Elon Musk, a fan of using tweets to signal his plans, is broadly hinting he will formally announce the payoff of the loans tomorrow.
Such a move, coming nine years ahead of schedule, could save Tesla significant interest costs even as taxpayers receive as much as a $12 million profit.
That would provide the Obama Administration a rare success in the highly controversial DOE loan program.
"Given govt loan repayment this week (prob Wed), Supercharger update will be next week," Musk said in his tweet.
Tesla recently reversed course, announcing plans for a new stock offering that initially was expected to generate around $800 million in cash. But with the Palo Alto-based firm's shares surging from around $34 a share to over $92 since March, Tesla plans to boost the size of the offering by 30 percent, or to more than $1 billion.
Along with paying off the DOE loan, Musk has suggested he would like to put some cash to developing additional products.
The current Model S sedan will be joined by the Model X crossover in 2014. He has long promised to introduce a smaller, less expensive vehicle that could increase Tesla sales significantly by targeting a more mainstream market segment. But Musk recently also dropped hints of other options, perhaps even an electric pickup truck.
LeBeau's Tesla Model S 'Test Drive' Ends
Tuesday, 19 Feb 2013 |  4:53  PM ET
CNBC's Phil LeBeau has been driving Tesla's Model S today and has arrived in Boston.
Tesla's upcoming stock offering follows a string of successes for the company.
The Model S has won a variety of kudos and was recently given one of the highest ratings ever by Consumer Reports magazine, 99 points out of a possible 100.
(Read more at The Detroit Bureau: More on Tesla's First-Ever Profit and Plans )
Sales could grow significantly, Musk has indicated, with the launch of sales in Europe and Asia during the third quarter of this year—and then with the addition of the Model X on track to debut during the final quarter of 2014.
Musk has repeatedly turned to Twitter and other social networks to build momentum—announcing a variety of moves aimed at building customer loyalty and confidence—no mean feat considering the general skepticism about battery propulsion.
Among the recent moves: a hybrid loan/lease program allowing buyers to return their Tesla vehicles for a guaranteed value, and a no-fault warranty program for the Model S battery pack.
(Read More: Tesla Alters Financing Program to Silence Critics )
Despite Musk's unbridled optimism, there remain plenty of skeptics, and perhaps for good reason considering the problems facing the nascent battery-car market as a whole.
Two other California start-ups have collapsed in recent weeks, little Coda filing for Chapter 11 protection and senior company officials suggesting Fisker Automotive could follow that path during hearings on Capitol Hill earlier this spring.
Despite drawing down $192 million of a larger loan from the DOE, Fisker has so far sold only about 2,500 Karma plug-in hybrids and has no cash left to finish development of the second, more mainstream model it hoped would buoy its balance sheet.

Skeptics note that despite Tesla's recent successes, all plug-in vehicles combined now account for barely 0.5 percent of the total U.S. new vehicle market.
Even adding in more conventional hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, the figure is still barely 3 percent. But proponents hope that with more products coming to market, and with a rapid increase in the number of public charging stations, demand could grow substantially over the next several years.
Fisker's impending collapse—it has already dismissed three-quarters of its staff—has put the spotlight on the DoE loan program which was intended to help encourage the development of low-emission, high-mileage vehicles.
There have been several other notable failures, including the bankruptcy of lithium-ion battery supplier A123.
But the White House is likely to point to Tesla's early payback as a counterpoint, a much-needed success story.

Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is expected to use the potentially $1 billion windfall from a new stock offering to both pay off the maker's $465 million in DOE loans, and to help fund additional products needed to help the car maker expand.

Adult film actress Chanel Preston
Chanel Preston knows not everyone approves of her chosen profession. That's one of the risks that go with being one of the biggest stars in porn . But she never thought it would affect her ability to open a bank account.
Preston recently opened a business account with City National Bank in Los Angeles. When she went to deposit checks into the account days later, however, she was told it had been shut down, due to "compliance issues."
She found the manager she had originally worked with and asked what had happened. The bank, she was told, was worried about the Webcam shows she had on her site and had revoked the account.
(City National declined to comment on Preston's accusations and on whether it had any policy regarding accounts tied to the porn industry.)
Preston is hardly the only porn star who has had trouble with the banking industry. Several performers and porn insiders (who were afraid to go on the record due to possible repercussions from their banks) said they have been denied accounts from a variety of financial institutions. (Related: Most Popular Adult Entertainment Stars )
"The people within my [local] bank have urged me to downplay the nature of my business because corporate frowns on it," said one long-time industry veteran.
The issue seems to be reaching a boiling point, though. Earlier this week, Marc Greenberg, founder of the soft porn studio MRG Entertainment, filed suit against JPMorgan Chase in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging the bank violated fair lending laws and its own policy for refusing to underwrite a loan for "moral reasons".
Greenberg says he was approached by a representative of the bank about refinancing an existing loan. But once he started the process, he says he saw repeated delays for four months. That's when he said he reached out to a JPMorgan vice president for an explanation.
The vice president "was evasive in his response to plaintiff's application status requests and finally informed plaintiff during a telephone conversation that plaintiff's loan application was refused due to 'moral reasons,' because of JPMorgan's disapproval of plaintiff's former source of income and occupation as an owner of a television production company that produced television programs that dealt with the subject of human sexuality," the complaint reads.
(MRG was sold to New Frontier Media in 2006 for $22 million. Related: The Power Brokers of Porn )
Greenberg's attorneys claim they were told by the vice president that the application was denied because of the potential "reputational risk" to the firm.
The rejection, noted the suit, was confounding since Chase had long held the original deed of trust on the home, without any comment on Greenberg's career.
"JPMorgan purports to be so ashamed of nudity and human sexuality that it cannot process a refinance of a home loan of plaintiff, secured by plaintiff's house, because plaintiff's source of income six years ago included production of television programs that contained nudity and human sexuality," the suit reads.
JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the accusations due to the pending litigation.
Preston noted she, too, has been denied a loan because of her profession—though at a different bank.
"[The loan officer] asked me 'are you affiliated with the adult entertainment industry?' When I said yes, she said 'We will not give you a loan.'," she said.
Whether the decision to deny Preston's business account or Greenberg's refinance application is discriminatory lending is a matter of debate—and, in Greenberg's case, something the courts will have to decide.
Adult Film Stars: How Our Industry Is Changing
It's the porn industry's equivalent of the Oscars -- and at this year's AVN Awards, it's all about the changing face of pornography.
David Barr, a spokesperson for the FDIC, however, said institutions are permitted to make their own calls on who they work with to a certain degree.
"The decision to open or maintain an account is up to the individual institution," he said. "The rules are not prescriptive, which means that the bank must make its own assessment to determine the risks associated with an account and whether that account should be terminated or not opened in the first place."
And it is not uncommon for many businesses to take a moral stand about who they do business with. Indeed, some investment firms make it a point to avoid getting involved with tobacco producers or gun manufacturers because of the social issues tied to those industries.
Porn stars and adult entertainment industry insiders do note that the troubles they've experienced are tied to business—not personal—accounts. That may be because personal accounts are opened under their real names, which typically don't raise an eyebrow, while business is done under more well-known pseudonyms, which is when people take notice.
"It's kind of obvious about what I do when a young girl goes into a Valley bank with a different female name than the one on [their] driver's license," said Preston.
But such friction between people involved in the adult entertainment industry and banking institutions are likely to become more common. With the advent of the Internet, the $14 billion adult entertainment industry is undergoing a transformation . Film and video distribution is giving way to Internet sites and Web cams . As a result, barriers to entry in the industry are being lowered and more of the industry is being based out of homes and being run through small business arrangements and partnerships, necessitating banking services.

May 21, 2013: 11:22 AM ET
The drugmaker plans to reincorporate in Ireland to reduce its tax burden, but the CEO will stay in New Jersey.
By Brian O'Keefe, assistant managing editor
Actavis CEO Paul Bisaro. Until a recent merger, Actavis was known as Watson Pharmaceuticals. The company's tenure on the 500 may be short-lived.
Fortune -- Drugmaker Actavis ( ACT ) announced yesterday that it will buy rival Warner Chilcott PLC for $5 billion in stock and that, as part of the deal, it plans to reincorporate itself in tax-friendly Ireland, where Warner Chilcott ( WCRX ) is based. This despite the fact that the company's top executives, including CEO Paul Bisaro, will continue to live and work in New Jersey.
"Everybody loves New Jersey too much, so nobody is willing to go," he said on a conference call yesterday.
The move makes Actavis the latest Fortune 500 company to "leave" the U.S. in search of a lower tax rate and thrusts the generic drug giant into the ongoing debate about corporate tax rates in the U.S. alongside tech giant Apple ( AAPL ).
By basing much of its international operations in Ireland, Apple has been able to save billions of dollars in taxes in recent years, according to the report of a U.S. Senate inquiry that was released yesterday. In testimony before a Senate hearing this morning, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that his company pays an "extraordinary amount" of U.S. taxes and doesn't take advantage of tax "gimmicks" to avoid them, even though the Senate investigation found that Apple had set up structures that allowed it to pay little or no taxes in any country on much of its income.
MORE: Apple vs. Subcommittee: Tim Cook has some explaining to do
For Actavis , the acquisition and reincorporation will punctuate a heady period. The company only recently completed a transformative merger and name change and has seen its stock skyrocket of late.
Earlier this month, the maker of generic and specialty drugs, formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, made its debut on the Fortune 500 at No. 432 with $5.9 billion in revenue. On the day the list was officially released, I visited the company's headquarters and interviewed CEO Bisaro for a story on what it's like to join the Fortune 500 . "Our intention is to be on the Fortune 500 for a long time," he told me.
But if Bisaro's merger and reincorporation plan goes forward as planned, Actavis will turn out to be a one-year wonder on the 500. Only companies domiciled in the U.S. are eligible for inclusion.
The acquisition of Warner Chilcott will give Actavis more brand-name drugs to balance against its generic portfolio and will bolster its already strong franchise of drugs for women's health. By bulking up, Actavis also may have a better chance to fend off potential suitors. In recent weeks, generic rivals Valeant Pharmaceuticals International ( VRX ) and Mylan ( MYL ) have both been rumored to be considering takeover bids for Actavis.
RELATED: The biggest merger you didn't hear about today
However, in a conference call with analysts to discuss the deal, Bisaro also extolled the added benefit of lowering his company's effective tax rate, which he forecast would drop from 28% to 17%. Based on Bisaro's strongly-held opinions about U.S. corporate tax policy, that must have been a major selling point for the deal.
Near the end of my interview with Bisaro earlier this month, I asked him a broad question about the stock market and he responded by bringing up the subject of corporate tax rates. "My own personal soapbox is that we've got to fix the disadvantage that American companies have -- America-based companies -- vs. other countries around the world," he said. "I know it's not a popular political issue but you've got to find a way to solve the tax problem."
It was clear that the disparity in corporate tax rates was a burning topic for him. "We're competing against companies that have much, much lower tax rates than we do," he went on, with growing excitement. "And we compete for the same investor base. So you can't put us at a disadvantage. We have to find ways around that, and often times it means moving jobs out of the United States. That can't be the policy that the government wants to follow. I think we have to step away from the rhetoric that 'we all need to pay our fair share' and all that other nonsense, and start thinking about, practically-speaking, how do we put more people to work?"
Actavis is hardly the first large, publicly traded company to reincorporate overseas for tax reasons. Two members of last year's Fortune 500, electronics maker Eaton ( ETN ) and insurance broker Aon ( AON ), dropped off the list this year after reincorporating to Ireland and the United Kingdom respectively. A 2011 study by Ernst & Young found that the U.S. had lost a total of 46 headquarters of Fortune Global 500 companies over the previous 11 years. Currently, a total of 21 companies currently included in the S&P 500 are technically headquartered overseas.
According to research published by the Cato Institute in September, the U.S. had an effective tax rate of 35.6% on new corporate investment, the fourth highest out of 90 countries studied and almost twice the average rate of the 90 countries.
It is clearly an issue that resonates with Bisaro, who joined Actavis as CEO in 2007 after a long run first as chief counsel and then president and COO of Barr Pharmaceuticals. He has has made significant changes at Actavis in his tenure. A few years ago, he moved the headquarters of the company, still known at the time as Watson Pharmaceuticals, from Corona, Calif., to Parsippany, N.J., in part to be nearer to talent in the pharma-heavy area but also, not incidentally, because Bisaro happens to live in the Garden State.
Last year, Bisaro engineered the acquisition of Swiss drug manufacturer Actavis and the board ultimately decided to adopt the Actavis name (and change its ticker symbol to ACT) because the Watson name is too common around the world and the company ran into copyright issues. The merger with Warner Chilcott is expected to close by the end of this year.
Actavis currently has 17,000 employees globally, about 5,400 of whom are employed in the U.S. Roughly 60% of the company's sales will be generated in the U.S. in 2013. That figure probably won't decrease in the near future. Even though Warner Chilcott is headquartered in Dublin, most of its sales are in North America.
Before my interview with Bisaro concluded, he decided to make his point about the deleterious effect of U.S. corporate tax rates one more time. "It can't be a good policy to say, 'We're going to tax you every time you do something, and therefore you're never going to do anything in the U.S,'" he said. "How is that good for Americans?"
Now he has found a way around that policy, even though he will still be living and driving to work in New Jersey.

10:55 AM
Sprint on Tuesday announced a revised offer for wireless broadband wholesaler Clearwire . The carrier is looking to acquire the remaining Clearwire shares  it does not already own for $2.97 per share, or $2.2 billion, valuing the company at $10 billion. Sprint has now increased its bid $3.40 per share, upping Clearwire’s value to $10.7 billion. The revised offer represents a 14% premium over the company’s earlier bid and a 162% premium over Clearwire’s closing share price in October when it was rumored to be part of  the Sprint-SoftBank merger discussions . Sprint notes that the offer is the best and final offer it will propose. The company’s press release follows below.
Sprint Submits Increased Offer for Clearwire
Increased Offer of $3.40 Per Share Represents Significant Premium to Unaffected Clearwire Trading Price
Offer Provides Clearwire Shareholders with Enhanced Value
Transaction is Best Strategic Alternative for Clearwire and Stockholders
OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (BUSINESS WIRE), May 21, 2013 – Sprint (NYSE:S) today announced that it has submitted an increased offer to the Board of Directors of Clearwire (NASDAQ: CLWR) to acquire the approximately 50 percent stake in the company it does not currently own for $3.40 per share, valuing Clearwire at $10.7 billion. This increased offer represents a 14 percent premium to Sprint’s previous offer of $2.97 announced on Dec. 17, 2012 and a 162 percent premium to Clearwire’s closing share price the day before the Sprint-SoftBank discussions were first confirmed in the marketplace on Oct. 11, 2012 when Clearwire was also speculated to be a part of that transaction. The offer represents Sprint’s best and final offer.
The revised offer demonstrates Sprint’s commitment to closing the Clearwire transaction and improving its competitive position in the U.S. wireless industry. Sprint is uniquely positioned to leverage Clearwire’s 2.5 GHz spectrum assets. Sprint’s Network Vision architecture should allow for better strategic alignment and the full utilization and integration of Clearwire’s complementary 2.5 GHz spectrum assets, while achieving operational efficiencies and improved service for customers as the spectrum and network is migrated to 4G LTE standards.
The revised offer has been submitted to the Clearwire Board of Directors and is subject to its formal approval. Clearwire’s Special Committee and Board have repeatedly cited the merger as the best strategic alternative for the company and its minority stockholders. In addition, Clearwire has received commitments from Comcast Corp., Intel Corp and Bright House Networks LLC, who collectively own approximately 26 percent of Clearwire’s shares not affiliated with Sprint, to vote their shares in support of the transaction.
Sprint’s proposal provides a clear path forward for Clearwire and the merger provides attractive value for shareholders of both companies.
Upon approval by the Clearwire Board of Directors, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of Clearwire’s stockholders, including the approval of a majority of Clearwire stockholders not affiliated with Sprint or SoftBank. SoftBank has consented to the increased offer to acquire the remaining stake of Clearwire.

The first killer app was VisiCalc . This early spreadsheet turned the Apple II from a hobbyist toy to a business computer. VisiCalc came with room for improvement, though. In addition, a new architecture and operating system, the Intel-based IBM PC and MS-DOS, also needed a spreadsheet to be taken seriously. That spreadsheet, released in early 1983, would be Lotus 1-2-3 , and it would change the world. It became the PC's killer app, and the world would never be the same.
On May 14, IBM quietly announced the end of the road for 1-2-3 , along with Lotus Organizer and the Lotus SmartSuite office suite. Lotus 1-2-3's day is done.
Say goodbye to Lotus 1-2-3. Its day is finally done. (Image: Wikimedia)
Far faster than its competition, such as SuperCalc and Microsoft's first spreadsheet, MultiPlan, Lotus 1-2-3 would become both IBM's and Microsoft's first killer app. With the opening of the Intel architecture and MS-DOS to IBM PC clones, Lotus 1-2-3 became the essential application for the 1980s PC revolution.
Its dominance would be short lived. 1-2-3 would face competition from programs such as Excel and Quatro Pro that would weaken its hold on the marketplace by the late 1980s. By the early 1990s, 1-2-3 had fallen into third place in the eyes of spreadsheet users . It would never recover.
When Microsoft Excel took over clear first place, Lotus was acquired by IBM in a hostile takeover in 1995 . While the expected culture war between the ultra-liberal Lotus and the buttoned-down IBM never happened, the acquisition didn't breath any new life into Lotus 1-2-3.
In 2012, IBM started retiring the Lotus brand . Now 1-2-3, the core product that brought Lotus its fame, takes its turn on the chopping block. IBM stated, "Effective on the dates listed below, [June 11, 2013] IBM will withdraw from marketing part numbers from the following product release(s) licensed under the IBM International Program License Agreement:" IBM Lotus 123 Millennium Edition V9.x, IBM Lotus SmartSuite 9.x V9.8.0, and Organizer V6.1.0.
Further, IBM stated, "Customers will no longer be able to receive support for these offerings after September 30, 2014. No service extensions will be offered. There will be no replacement programs."
While Lotus' groupware client program Notes and its server component Domino will live on, IBM will no longer be offering any Lotus-branded programs. As for 1-2-3 itself, 30 years after it helped start the personal computing revolution, this essential PC program will be put out to pasture.

By John Aziz | The Week –  22 hrs ago

Solar power is getting much easier to store — and at a much cheaper price
The total solar energy hitting the Earth each year is equivalent to 12.2 trillion watt-hours . That's over 20,000 times more than the total energy all of humanity consumes each year.
And yet photovoltaic solar panels, the instruments that convert solar radiation into electricity, produce only 0.7 percent of the energy the world uses .
SEE MORE: The politics behind Kanye West's 'New Slaves'
So what gives?
For one, cost: The U.S. Department of Energy estimates an average cost of $156.90 per megawatt-hour for solar, while conventional coal costs an average of $99.60 per MW/h, nuclear costs an average of $112.70 per MW/h, and various forms of natural gas cost between $65.50 and $132 per MW/h. So from an economic standpoint, solar is still uncompetitive.
And from a technical standpoint, solar is still tough to store. "A major conundrum with solar panels has always been how to keep the lights on when the sun isn't shining," says Christoph Steitz and Stephen Jewkes at Reuters .
But thanks to huge advancements, solar's cost and technology problems are increasingly closer to being solved.

(Bloomberg & New Energy Finance)
The percentage of light turned into electricity by a photovoltaic cell has increased from 8 percent in the first Cadmium-Telluride cells in the mid-1970s to up to 44 percent in the most efficient cells today, with some new designs theoretically having up to 51 percent efficiency. That means you get a lot more bang for your buck. And manufacturing costs have plunged as more companies have entered the market, particularly in China. Prices have fallen from around $4 per watt in 2008 to just $0.75 per watt last year to just $0.58 per watt today.
If the trend stays on track for another 8-10 years, solar generated electricity in the U.S. would descend to a level of $120 per MW/h — competitive with coal and nuclear — by 2020, or even 2015 for the sunniest parts of America. If prices continue to fall over the next 20 years, solar costs would be half that of coal (and have the added benefits of zero carbon emissions, zero mining costs, and zero scarcity).
SEE MORE: WATCH: Live coverage of the Oklahoma City tornado
Scientists have made huge advances in thermal storage as well, finding vastly more efficient ways to store solar energy. (In one example, solar energy is captured and then stored in beds of packed rocks.)
Lower costs and better storage capacity would mean cheap, decentralized, plentiful, sustainable energy production — and massive relief to global markets that have been squeezed in recent years by the rising cost of fossil fuel extraction , a burden passed on to the consumer. All else being equal, falling energy prices mean more disposable income to save and invest, or to spend.
SEE MORE: Angry at the government? 5 ways you can fight back
The prospect of widespread falling energy costs could be a basis for a period of strong economic growth. It could help us replace our dependence on foreign oil with a robust, decentralized electric grid, where energy is generated closer to the point of use. This would mean a sustainable energy supercycle — and new growth in other industries that benefit from falling energy costs.
Indeed, a solar boom could prove wrong those who claim that humanity has over-extended itself and that the era of growth is over.

http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/Muhammad-Yunus-LSE|by Ian Wright
May 21, 2013 - 05:05
A NOBEL Peace Prize winner and banker to the poor has made the bold claim that poverty, unemployment and welfare could soon seem so archaic, they will be only referred to in museums.
Speaking at the London School of Economics in May, Muhammad Yunus told a packed theatre the world's huge unemployment problem could be solved if instead of looking for work, we gave work to others.
He called for an end to ‘profit-maximizing money-making robots' and for a focus on creating social businesses which help the world's poor.
He suggested if each person in the LSE audience started a social business that employed five other people, we could be well under way to solving poverty and unemployment in the UK, which would in turn mean no more need for welfare.
He said: "Capitalism is about options, so shouldn't people have the option to start a social business or a profit maximizing business or both? You have to use your creative power to make it happen. Nothing is beyond the capacity of human beings."
"Every time I see a problem I think, how do I create a business to solve the problem?"
And it seems he practises what he preaches, besides starting Grameen Bank , which now has 8.5 million customers in Bangladesh and 12,000 in New York City,  he has also founded a staggering 60 other social businesses to help the world's poor.
These include partnerships with some of the world's largest companies including Danone, Adidas, and BASF.
In a thinly veiled jab at the audience of mostly privileged students, Mr Yunus told the story of a group of graduates who had a difficult time finding work. They asked him why they had bothered to study if there weren't any jobs available. He challenged them to give jobs not ask for jobs.
He added: "If you change the mindset of enough people around the world, it could mean the end poverty, unemployment and the need for welfare globally."
He also discussed philanthropy admitting while he believes in it in principle; it's not the best way to help the poor, because the money can only be used once.
He said social businesses will always be the better option because they reinvest money, meaning it can help people over and over again.
He also admitted while there are many capitalistic models that do work, including China's massive economic growth, it is likely they will never help the poorest.
Other topics he discussed included:
• Wages: He proposed an international minimum wage for workers in the garment industry and transparency index to name and shame companies that employed people in substandard conditions.
• The media: It should play a bigger role in promoting social business. Using the example of science fiction's role in helping humans land on the moon, and creating the modern interconnected world, he called for social fiction to inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs.
• The nature of unemployment: Yunus claimed it was a human invention and, "You don't think about animals as being unemployed. And if you do then it's probably owned by a human."
• Bankers:  "If I'm a banker to the poor then the other banker is a banker to the rich. He's the funny one"

While the clock ticks and SAC Capital founder Steven Cohen contemplates a more complicated future, SAC watchers have been focused closely on the end of July, after which, it is presumed, the billionaire art collector may be able to let out a deep sigh of relief. That is when the five-year statute of limitations expires on trades in Elan ( ELN ) and Wyeth ( PFE ) that form the basis of an insider trading case filed in November against former SAC portfolio manager Mathew Martoma. Cohen, the government alleges, participated in those Martoma trades, which occurred in July 2008. If the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and/or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can build a case against him based on those trades, they have to bring it in the next four weeks. But an even more important deadline is looming a few weeks later.
On August 26, 2008, Jon Horvath, an analyst who was then employed at Sigma Capital, a unit of SAC, sent an e-mail to one of his superiors, a portfolio manager at SAC’s $2 billion Sigma Capital Fund named Gabriel Plotkin: “I have a 2nd hand read from someone at the company—this is 3rd quarter I have gotten this read from them and it has been very good in the last quarters,” read the e-mail, according to an SEC complaint. “They are seeing GMs miss by 50-80 [basis points] due to poor mix, [operating expenses] in-line and a little revenue upside netting out to an [earnings per share] miss … Please keep to yourself as obviously not well known.” The e-mail was referring to the computer maker Dell ( DELL ), which was to report its second-quarter earnings two days later. Horvath, the government alleges, was discussing Dell’s results, gleaned from a company insider before they were public, which would clearly put the information over the line into illegal territory.
Another Sigma portfolio manager, Michael Steinberg, who has since been charged by the government for insider trading over the Dell trades, was copied on the e-mail, and responded: “yes, normally we would never divulge data like this, so please be discreet.”
Shortly after getting Horvath’s message, Plotkin began dumping Dell shares held by the Sigma Capital Fund, ultimately selling 600,000 of them by the time Dell’s earnings were announced, according to the complaint. Steinberg and Plotkin also sold shares on behalf of the SAC Select Fund, another fund in the SAC family.
They weren’t the only ones at SAC Capital exchanging information about Dell. “Guys, I was talking to Steve about Dell earlier today and he asked me to get the two of you to compare notes before the print, as we are on opposite sides of this one,” Steinberg wrote in an e-mail to Horvath and Plotkin. The “Steve” refers to their boss Steven Cohen, who engaged in his own Dell trading at the time. The e-mails became public during the trial of Anthony Chiasson, the former SAC trader and Level Global Investors founder, and Todd Newman, of Diamondback Capital, who were both convicted of insider trading in December. In the absence of testimony from Martoma—who has, thus far, refused to cooperate with the government—Cohen is far more vulnerable to charges over Dell, according to a person familiar with the matter. Those cursed Dell trades have already taken down at least half a dozen traders. By the time August arrives, Cohen will likely wish he’d never heard of Dell.
Horvath pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with the government; Steinberg has pleaded not guilty; Plotkin and Cohen have not been charged. “Gabe Plotkin has not been accused of wrongdoing and has done nothing wrong,” SAC has said previously. “He has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research.”

Memo to Mayer: 7 things so you don't 'screw up' Tumblr
Go slowly on Tumblr.  That was the key message for Yahoo management by investors and industry watchers as they digest Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that was announced Monday.

Memo to Mayer: 7 things so you don't 'screw up' Tumblr
Roger Yu, USA TODAY6:56 p.m. EDT May 21, 2013

In announcing the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr on Monday, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer now famously promised not to "screw up" the hot social-media site for Millennials.
That was seen as part promise to Tumblr's innovative staff, which she needs, and part promise to Tumblr's fans, who already were loading up the site with their fears and protests. It also was a not-so-veiled reference to Yahoo's pre-Mayer track record of letting acquisitions wither for lack of interest and support (the most relevant example here being Flickr). And it might even have been a warning to her own Yahoo staff.
But the vow also set off a flurry of advice from analysts, experts and shareholders on things she should do to keep her promise. Here are seven highlights:
• No. 1: Go slow. That was the key message from analysts and experts. Like a parent adopting a creative but unruly child, they say, the search giant should take time and care in integrating operations and let be, with support, the way Tumblr's compelling blog posts are created and shared — even if some popular user accounts contain content that is unsavory, amateurish, pornographic or not properly licensed.
"Make sure the integration is just in the back-end, and nurture (Tumblr's) independence," says Ryan Jacob, fund manager of Jacob Internet Fund, a Yahoo shareholder, when asked what he would tell Mayer. "Make sure they continue to grow the way they have, and be the parent that can provide operational resources that companies like Tumblr need. I think Yahoo has to be really careful. It'll be a mistake to try to subsume it into Yahoo's bureaucracy."
• No.2: Give Tumblr real autonomy. David Karp, the 26-year-old founder of Tumblr, and his young team should be given the autonomy to run the company from his New York office without interference from the West Coast, Jacob and others say.
Yahoo should counsel Tumblr on selling and delivering ads for buyers, Jacob says, but avoid the temptation to dictate content. "Tumblr has done a terrific job on their own in managing (content)," he says.
Karp, who'll remain CEO, also apparently has been led to expect autonomy. In a message to his team, he wrote that Tumblr "is not turning purple," a reference to Yahoo's logo. "Our headquarters isn't moving. Our team isn't changing. Our road map isn't changing, Tumblr gets better faster. The work ahead of us remains the same."
• No. 3: Identify Tumblr's core audience — and use it. Yahoo and Tumblr management must study and understand the behavior and preferences of Tumblr's core users, says Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University. "Active users will be the initial targets for advertising."
How many there are and what they do are among the initial things to nail down. Yahoo claims there are 300 million unique visitors per month, while ComScore reports about 117 million worldwide unique visitors in April. "There's a lot of discrepancy," he says. "And how many of those active users are accessing (inappropriate) content?"
• No. 4. Tread very carefully in introducing ads. Yahoo already is facing an onslaught of online petitions from Tumblr fans who are afraid of ad intrusion as Yahoo tries to "monetize" its acquisition. Tumblr, which relies on user-generated content, from professionally produced videos by large organizations such as Comedy Central to silly GIF images by teenagers, only started selling ads last year. But in the long run, it's the only way either company makes money.
Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, says Mayer has an opportunity, if done right, to prod a large base of Tumblr users to produce a volume of premium content for selling ads — "inventory" in adspeak. But he says he challenge will be to "thread the needle" between holding onto Tumblr's users to create that inventory, while creating innovative ad products that appeal to ad buyers, without turning off the users.
Tumblr's minimalist appearance has always been a selling point for users, and a sudden onslaught of randomly placed ads could drive many of them away, says Simon Dumenco, media columnist for Advertising Age. "There are people who will abandon any website that they feel they have personal ownership but has become cluttered with junk," he says, citing MySpace as an example.
"Going slow is the only real way to preserve the purchase. If (Yahoo) is willing to take this financial hit, they're willing to take the financial hit in going slow and not flood it with ads."
• No. 5: Create ads specific to Tumblr content.Yahoo's ad strategy should center on ads that are "native" to Tumblr's blog content, with placements that flow with other posts without disrupting the user-experience and make messages relevant to the readers of particular blogs, Schloetzer says.
For example, a car manufacturer could place GIF images of  fans converting one of its cars into a racer and place them on blogs followed by racing fans.
"If I can successfully target native ads to this (active user) group, Yahoo can grow a business in which Tumblr provides ad-agency support for firms that want to develop Tumblr-appropriate ads for younger users," Schloetzer says. "Yahoo can (offer) Tumblr experience in pushing ads, but Tumblr can use its knowledge of its users to do a better job of crafting that advertising experience."
• No. 6: Create content, not just ads. Dumenco agrees with Wieser that  Yahoo-Tumblr's ad strategy should focus on its "premium" blogs — the best ones that drive the largest part of the site's traffic and that likely attract viewers who will tolerate well-done promotional messages in exchange for the reliable entertainment or useful information.
Google's YouTube suffered initially from a flood of amateurish home videos only to see its content quality steadily improve over the years, in part through YouTube's investment in original content and support for video producers.
Yahoo-Tumblr should consider a similar strategy in investing in original content, Dumenco says. "A lot of (its) blogs aren't getting traffic," he says. "The trick here is that they have to figure out a way to attract and (make money from) their best bloggers. (Ask them) 'What can we do to work together to make it a co-enterprise?'"
• No. 7: Communicate how this will work. Rather than deliberately distancing itself from Tumblr to try to preserve Tumblr's hip quotient, Mayer should communicate clearly how Yahoo and Tumblr may and may not work together in selling ads, says Renee Miller, founder of integrated advertising and marketing firm Miller Group in Los Angeles.
"There's a big disconnect between Tumblr and Yahoo," she says. "Explain to clients what's in it for them. Give me a reason to buy. At this point, I don't see any benefits."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22598906|Sewage tech lets companies sort profit from Dubai poo
By Jonathan Frewin Business reporter, BBC News, Dubai
Filthy lucre: Over the last five years Dubai has used technology to transform how it deals with the contents of the region's toilets
Mohammed Abdulaziz Al Awadhi is a man passionate about human waste.
Finding the perfect fit
He's been involved in Dubai's sewage treatment for a quarter of a century, and is now director of Dubai's sewage treatment plants.
In a crisp, white, immaculately clean dishdasha, or full length robe, he cuts a slightly incongruous figure at the city's Jebel Ali sewage treatment plant.
Around three-quarters of the waste processed there arrives through Dubai's network of sewers.
But still, around a quarter arrives in giant orange tankers, coming from labourer accommodation, mostly on the outskirts of the city.
Wood, plastics and other solids are removed from the sewage
It's the start of a process that turns out a number of by-products, including refined water that is used for agriculture and horticulture.
Where there's muck
Mr Al Awadhi says this is the only way the city can afford to keep parks and green spaces growing so vibrantly.
"Potable water in this part of the world is a commodity which is produced and desalinated and the cost to the government is roughly two dollars per cubic metre," he says.
"Compare that to waste water which is produced from our sewage treatment plant which is costing about half a dollar per cubic metre."
Once the solids are removed the liquid sewage undergoes a series of biological and mechanical purifying processes
"This water makes it economically feasible to ensure that we have such a wide spread of horticulture and agriculture in the city."
WATCH: The BBC's Jonathan Frewin visits Dubai’s Jebel Ali sewage treatment plant
Of course human waste contains quite a lot of nutrients, and once waste water has had plastics, wood and other solids removed, it goes through a range of biological and mechanical processes that keep the treatment plant - amazingly - virtually odour-free.
"Due to the sudden rapid growth of the city, the issues were with the tankers being queued in the long queues, some locations they had to wait up to 40 hours," says Mr Al Awadhi.
"Apart from that because the plant was overloaded, the final product was not meeting exactly the design requirements. And it was discomfort to the public."
Respect the queue: Just five years ago Dubai had only one sewage treatment plant, leaving tankers waiting outside for up to 40 hours
But the economic slowdown, which reduced sewage production, combined with fast-tracking construction of the Jebel Ali sewage treatment plant, meant the city finally had a sewage treatment system that could overcome those challenges.
Smell of success
But it's not just about centralised sewage treatment in this part of the world.
Sewage has created a home for dragonflies and wildlife
On the outskirts of the city sits a desert jungle where brightly coloured dragonflies mingle with rare birds. This is the Al Barari residential community of about two hundred homes which has its very own sewage treatment works.
The output from that is mixed with water from the government plants, and then put through a further process to ensure the water in extensive waterways around the development doesn't get clogged up with algae.
"It's a sustainable development. I think the vision of the developers was to have a closed loop for their water cycle they wanted to be able to use in their greenery," says Concorde Corodex's director of business development, Mohanned Awad.
"Having a system that's portable and mobile was also important, they wanted to minimise both the footprint and the installation time."
This development of just 200 homes has its own sewage treatment works, which feeds the garden water system
Concorde Corodex is a local company but has been experiencing success exporting its products across the entire region.
"We've exported into basically all regions of the Middle East, North Africa, we have systems in Nigeria, Ghana; we were asked by the United Nations to deliver systems in Sudan," says Mr Awad.
"We have systems in Oman, Yemen. Basically, any area which is a residential area that usually has a septic system or a rural area will look towards a packaged system as a solution to treat their sewage, just because of ease of installation, and ease of operation," he says.
"The science behind these systems is usually in the biology, but the mechanical components are actually very simple to operate and can be done by simple mechanical operators."
Pure science
It's possible to process the water to even higher levels for other uses.
"There's other technologies we've used... called MBR or membrane bioreactor technology, that will actually treat water to a potable state," says Mr Awad.
Processed sewage sludge is made into fertiliser and sold
"We're not suggesting you drink it, there's actually a lot of applications for ultra purified water, processed water for cooling, water for processes in industrial areas. The applications are really varied, and the technology does exist to treat water to very high levels."
Back at the main sewage treatment plant, there's another by-product which might come as a surprise.
Sludge that was separated from the incoming water gets baked and dried using methane gas which is yet another by-product of the treatment process.
Granules then get bagged and sold to gardeners all across the city as a fertiliser of human origin; a bargain, perhaps, at $2.50 for 25kg.
And clearly demonstrating that in the end, very little to do with waste water in this part of the world,  actually goes to waste.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/20/congressional_tax_investigators_excoriate_apple/|Watch Now : Virtual Machine Movement with Hyper-V
A US Senate investigation has found that Apple avoided billions of dollars in taxes through a complex scheme of subsidiaries scattered around the globe, some with no employees and run by top execs back in its Cupertino headquarters.
"Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven," said Senator Carl Levin, The New York Times reports . "Apple sought the holy grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars while claiming to be tax resident nowhere."
Levin is a Democrat from Michigan, but the Apple excoriation was bipartisan. "Apple claims to be the largest US corporate taxpayer," said Arizona Republican John McCain, "but by sheer size and scale, it is also among America's largest tax avoiders."
McCain also said that Apple is "purposefully depriving the American people of revenue" by using a "byzantine" tax structure, according to ABC News .
According to the NYT, in 2011 one of Apple's subsidiaries, located in Ireland, paid a mere 0.05 per cent in tax on $22bn in revenues. Another subsidiary did not even file tax returns – anywhere. The NYT reports that group "paid almost nothing on $30 billion in profits since 2009."
Also according to the NYT, the investigators from the rather ominously named Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Levin chairs, say that Apple's tax strategy moved "at least $74 billion" out of the reach of the IRS between 2009 and 2012.
Apple's cash reserves stood at over $145bn as of its last financial report, about $100bn of which is held offshore.
The investigators' findings come one day before Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to appear at a hearing of the Subcommittee, and on Monday Apple released the text of the statement he will deliver at that hearing. Needless to say, Apple defines its tax activities in terms somewhat less harsh than do Levin and McCain.
"Apple ... employs tens of thousands of Americans, creates revolutionary products that improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans, and pays billions of dollars annually to the US Treasury in corporate income and payroll taxes," Cook will tell his inquisitors.
"Apple complies fully with both the laws and spirit of the laws," the statement reads. "And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this country and abroad."
That statement goes on to describe Apple as a "powerful engine of job creation in the US," one that "pays an extraordinary amount in US taxes," "does not use tax gimmicks," and is "an American success story."
Concerning the Irish question specifically, the statement says, "Apple does not move its intellectual property into offshore tax havens and use it to sell products back into the US to avoid US tax, nor does it use revolving loans from [Controlled Foreign Corporations] to fund its domestic operations."
So what's the problem, then? We'll learn more at Tuesday's hearing, most likely, after Monday's traditional "Let's fight it out in the press first" dueling press releases, statements, and leaks.
But one thing is certain through all this back-and-forth: the US corporate tax code – hell, the entire US tax code – is broken. Riddled with loopholes, obfuscated in thousands of pages of legalese, and larded with well-paid-for special-interest exemptions, the tax-law morass makes the Augean stables – the clean-up of which having been Hercules' fifth labor – look as immaculate as a surgically sterilized operating room.
In fact, this entire corporate-tax dust-up – about which Google Eric Schmidt has also weighed in – is a prelude to the real battle: modifying the tax code to make it more business-friendly – or, as Cook will tell the Subcommittee on Tuesday, "to dramatically [simplify] the US corporate tax system."
To that end, Cook will tell the hearing that a new tax code should:
• Be revenue neutral;
• Eliminate all corporate tax expenditures;
• Lower corporate income tax rates; and
• Implement a reasonable tax on foreign earnings that allows free movement of capital back to the US.
Referring to Apple's use of "stateless" subsidiaries to avoid US taxes, one tax-law expert told the NYT, "There is a technical term economists like to use for behavior like this. Unbelievable chutzpah." ®

http://techland.time.com/2013/05/18/facebooks-stock-price-the-least-important-thing-about-facebook/|Follow @techland
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is fond of telling his cohorts that their journey is only one percent finished. Even if you quibble about the exact percentage, he’s right that his company’s vision is boundless and that the service, in its current incarnation, is nowhere near done exploring its potential. The man is nothing if not both ambitious and patient.
Wall Street, unlike Zuck, is famously bad at taking the long view of things. When Facebook went public , a year ago today, shares were snapped up by speculators hoping to make an insta-windfall from a pop in its stock price. At the end of the first day of trading — bedeviled by NASDAQ technical gremlins — the stock flatlined rather than popping. In the year since, as my colleague Sam Gustin reports , it’s bumped around without ever returning to the initial offering price of $38. Some people are still brooding about it.
If you’ve lost money on Facebook stock, I feel for ya. Really. But the fact that it didn’t turn out to be a convenient way to turn a quick buck doesn’t have much bearing on the company’s importance to the world. It doesn’t even say much about the its long-term prospects to do well by investors.
Plenty of tech companies have had happier IPOs than Facebook did, but a happy IPO has never been a reliable sign of a bright future. Consider Netscape, the browser pioneer which went public in 1995, in what may remain the most iconic tech-company IPO of them all. In 2003. Jim Cramer, now the host of CNBC’s Mad Money, wrote a wistful remembrance of it for TIME :
We didn’t know what it was. We had never opened a browser. We had never gone on the Net. But we had heard that the deal would be hot, so we at Cramer & Co., my $250 million hedge fund, dutifully put in our share of stock in the initial public offering of Netscape. We got several thousand shares. And we, along with most everyone who got some, made an absolute killing. The stock, which we thought was going to be priced at $12 a share, came in at $28 and then opened at $71. (It peaked at $97.62 on March 17, 1999) We were giddy. We had never made money that quickly in our lives. We thought it was going to be a one-time event, never to be repeated.
The Netscape IPO was fabulous if you got in on it, but it was also Netscape’s last great moment of unbridled glory. After doing more than anybody else to popularize the web, the company got distracted by side projects such as business software at the same time that Microsoft began bundling the increasingly formidable Internet Explorer with Windows. In 1998, when AOL agreed to buy Netscape for $4.2 billion , it already felt like it was buying damaged goods. It never did much with its new toy, and killed the browser altogether in 2007.
Facebook is already at least as important to the web as Netscape was in its day, or almost any other company (hello, Google!) has been since. Making that case feels redundant, but let’s recap a few basic numbers anyhow: 1.11 billion monthly active members (751 million of whom use Facebook on mobile devices), 300 million photos uploaded a day, 16 million events created a month. Through features such as Facebook Connect (which lets you use a Facebook account to log into other sites) and those omnipresent Like buttons, the service also provides essential connective tissue to millions of other sites.
If you went through an It’s a Wonderful Life-like exercise of imagining what the web would look like in 2013 if Facebook had never been born, you’d envision a significantly different place. That’s true whether you see it as a positive force or a privacy-invading scourge. And while it’s fashionable to speculate that Facebook’s original audience, young people, no longer think it’s cool , that too is a sign of its dominance of social networking: It’s tough to stay cool when you’re as popular with grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles around the world as you are with teens and tweens.
Facebook’s impact on society makes it fascinating, but it doesn’t, of course, make it a successful business or a sound investment. Not automatically, anyhow. Especially since part of the 99 percent of Facebook’s journey that remains unfinished is finding a business model which is as transformative as the service it provides to consumers.
Most Facebook members have never paid it a nickel directly. The methods it does have to extract cash from them — it keeps suggesting that I give Starbucks gift cards as birthday presents — are unlikely to ever add up to enormous sums. Therefore, it’s marketing messages of one sort or another which will bring in most of the money, and while the company made almost $1.5 billion in revenue last quarter, it has the potential to do far better.
Facebook skeptics may be worried about the amount of information the company has on its users, but anyone who uses Facebook and pays attention to the ads can tell that the company hasn’t yet cracked the code of turning all that information into highly-targeted advertising of the sort that advertisers crave. Earlier this week, for instance, I pulled up my Facebook page and found ads for the Mormon Church’s newsroom, a dating service, a technical-certification school and a contest involving uploading photos of oneself flossing. None of them were a match for my interests, and the dating ad was particularly discordant considering that Facebook knows I’m married. If the service knows too much about me, it’s sure failing to do much with that knowledge.
It’s worth noting that Google established a powerfully effective business model before it went public in 2004: text ads next to search results, auctioned off to the highest bidder. If Facebook ever comes up with anything remotely as potent, people will stop writing articles saying that there’s no way it can turn a meaningful profit .
Over time, Facebook could become a cash cow; it could struggle to satisfy investors; it could grow even more dominant; it could lose ground to some shiny new thing that hasn’t been invented yet. But decades from now, when people look back and argue about Mark Zuckerberg’s legacy — and they will — I’ll be astonished if anyone remembers him principally as that guy whose IPO didn’t live up to expectations. This first anniversary seems as good a time as any to stop obsessing over it.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-20/apple-seeking-simpler-u-s-tax-code-urges-lower-corporate-rates.html|Apple Urges Simpler U.S. Tax Code Ahead of Senate Hearing
By Adam Satariano - 2013-05-20T20:33:11Z
Apple Inc. (AAPL) , outlining proposals for a simplification of the U.S. corporate-tax system, urged Congress to lower tax rates and implement levies on foreign earnings that will enable “free movement” of capital back to the U.S.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook will face questioning tomorrow from a Senate panel investigating how companies use various maneuvers to reduce their tax bills. It’s a rare appearance on Capitol Hill for Apple, which has largely avoided scrutiny.
Cook’s testimony follows a plan unveiled by Apple last month to return $100 billion in cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks through 2015. Rather than using funds overseas that will be taxed, Apple is borrowing money for the payout, saving as much as $9.2 billion in taxes, according to Moody’s Investment Services. Apple’s tax proposals will stimulate the creation of U.S. jobs, boost domestic investment and promote economic growth, the company said.
“These and other improvements in the U.S. corporate-tax system may increase the company’s taxes,” Cupertino, California-based Apple said in prepared testimony due to be delivered tomorrow. “Apple is not opposed to such a result if it occurs in the context of an overall improvement in efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness.”
Digital Economy
The U.S. tax system “has not kept pace with the advent of the digital age and rapidly changing digital economy,” Apple said. The company said the tax code should be simplified in a way that implements a “reasonable tax” on foreign earnings to encourage U.S. companies to repatriate the cash.
“The current system, which applies industrial era concepts to a digital economy, actually undermines U.S. competitiveness,” Apple said in its prepared remarks.
The U.S. corporate-tax rate of 35 percent is too high for companies to pay when bringing money back from overseas, Cook said in press interviews last week.
Apple said it expects to pay $7 billion in U.S. taxes this fiscal year ending in September, up from $6 billion during the prior year. The company said its impact on the U.S. economy also includes supporting about 600,000 jobs, including almost 50,000 at Apple itself and 550,000 in areas such as software engineering and manufacturing.
The company said in the prepared remarks that it doesn’t use “tax gimmicks,” such as moving intellectual property into offshore havens, or hold money on a “Caribbean island” to lower tax bills. Apple said it has a large amount of foreign cash because 61 percent of its sales last year came from outside the U.S.
Apple defended its use of international affiliates in Ireland, which have allowed the company to pay a lower tax rate on foreign profits. The subsidiaries provide a base of operations for activities such as sales, supply chain management and customer support, Apple said.

Tumblr pornographers, take heart: Yahoo comes in peace.
During an investor call Monday morning announcing Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition of media network Tumblr, Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer emphasized that Yahoo wants to "let Tumblr be Tumblr," which she suggested would include allowing its numerous X-rated accounts to continue pumping out pornography undisturbed.
Asked by an investor how Yahoo would balance user and advertiser interests with regard to Tumblr content that is "not as brand safe as the rest of Yahoo" -- content that presumably includes posts by sexually explicit Tumblrs such as "Red Hot Porn," "Porn and Weed" and "Secretary Sex" -- Mayer noted that the diversity of Tumblr's content was "exciting" because it allowed Tumblr, and by extension Yahoo, to reach a far wider audience. She explained that carefully targeting ad placement should allay the concerns of marketers who might be skittish about placing their brand alongside explicit content.
"I think the richness and breadth of content available on Tumblr -- even though it may not be as brand safe as what's on our site -- is what's really exciting and allows us to reach even more users," said Mayer, who did not mention pornography as such, but referred obliquely to content that was not "brand safe." "One of the ways to start measuring our growth story here is around traffic and users, and this obviously produces a lot of that. In terms of how to address advertisers' concerns around brand safety, we need to have good tools for targeting."
Conscious of the threat of a mass exodus by Tumblr devotees wary of a corporate overlord, Mayer has repeatedly stressed that Yahoo will allow Tumblr to operate independently, and promised in a blog post about the acquisition that the tech giant would " not screw it up ."
Tumblr chief executive David Karp, who was not present on the investor call Monday, wrote in his own blog, " We're not turning purple ." Yahoo will keep Tumblr's team intact, noted Mayer, to whom Karp will report directly.
"In terms of the integration between the two sites, we plan to operate and brand and grow Tumblr separately from Yahoo," Mayer said during her call with investors. "We will not have Yahoo branding on the Tumblr site. We want to let Tumblr be Tumblr, and let Yahoo be Yahoo."
Tumblr's guidelines are upfront about the site's tolerance for explicit material, and merely ask users who share "sexual or adult-oriented content" to tag it "NSFW" ("Not Suitable for Work") so people can filter it out of their feed if they so desire. Tumblr also asks content creators not to upload sexually explicit videos using its video-sharing tool (" We're not in the business of profiting from adult-oriented videos and hosting this stuff is f***ing expensive ."), but helpfully suggests they could use a service like xHamster.
Peter Shankman , a marketing expert and author of "Nice Companies Finish First," argues that Tumblr's extensive collection of pornography will do little to dissuade advertisers from buying real estate on the site, so long as the media network can offer access to the users and demographics brands seek to reach.
"Advertisers go where the audiences that matter to them are. They always have and they always will," said Shankman. "Yahoo will have the ability to create tools that help prevent some of that [explicit material] from being seen by people who shouldn't see it, and that will benefit advertisers. In the long run, I don't see advertisers running away from this any more than Twitter, or Vine, or Instagram. There's porn. It exists. It's 2013 and it's available anywhere."
But whether Tumblrers like it or not, more advertising will be coming to the blogging service, and Mayer said that Yahoo might feature Tumblr content on its main site. She also discussed the possibility of working with Tumblr bloggers to post ads on their sites, with their permission.
Mayer declined to go into detail about Tumblr's plans for advertising targeted to users' interests -- be it fashion, art or perhaps even pornography -- but noted that the "psychographic profiles on Tumblr are different from what we have on Yahoo, which enriches the user base and makes it that much more interesting to advertisers."
She ended the call by quoting a line from David Fincher's film "The Social Network," which she said summarized Tumblr's advertising evolution and readiness to feature more ads.
"It's like the line from 'The Social Network' movie: 'Why would you monetize it? You don't even know what 'it' is yet,'" said Mayer. "Tumblr is now at the point ... [where] they know what 'it' is, and it makes sense to monetize it in a way that is tasteful and seamless."

Go
Yahoo! ( YHOO ) has purchased Tumblr at a particularly difficult time in the life cycle of a Web startup. The users are there, creating and reading posts, asking the company for nothing except reliable server performance—and nothing in the way of major changes. Now it falls to Yahoo to figure out how to turn that traffic into revenue, a problem that continues to bedevil pretty much every popular social-media property on the Web.
To understand the nature of that challenge, it helps to look at the content, and the traffic, that Yahoo is buying. There is the porn , obviously. To recap, approximately one in every six pages on Tumblr has some kind of adult content, according to PrivCo , a firm that tracks private companies. Tumblr has been quietly chopping down on the smut, and only one of its top 25 sites today is pornographic, according to Quantcast.
The rest of Tumblr’s most popular blogs are SFW, but they’re not exactly mainstream. The single most-visited Tumblr is dedicated to Minecraft, followed by a Portuguese-language site specializing in animated GIFS and one that translates people’s names into various languages spoken on science fiction shows. Professional media outlets and brands make up three of the top 25 (Comedy Central; Clarin, the Argentine newspaper; and Angry Birds). Other particularly popular sites are a blog juxtaposing handsome men and adorable kittens; a blog shaming people who act like douchebags on other social-media platforms; and various collections of cartoons.
Not to take anything away from animated GIFs. Some people love that stuff, 12- to 25-year-olds in particular . But much of what appeals to Tumblr’s audience might be hard to sell ads against, said Allen Weiner, an analyst at Gartner. He says that Yahoo’s task will be to break up Tumblr into different buckets of content, focusing on what it can sell ads against, and letting the other stuff live on without interference—or revenue. “There’s a bucket that will have no monetary value—none,” he said.
The other question is where Tumblr will find new users. There are only so many hipsters, and Tumblr may be reaching the limits of its growth.
After drawing a record 90 million unique users in November, Tumblr has been bringing in fewer people both through the Web and mobile, according to Quantcast . Over the last month, 75.3 million people visited Tumblr blogs. Sam Hamadesh, founder and chief executive of Privco, says Tumblr could grow internationally but probably isn’t going to begin appealing to older users in the way that, say, Facebook ( FB ) did.
“The traffic has peaked, unless they can find a way to move upmarket,” he said. “There aren’t a lot of grandparents dying to get onto Tumblr.”

BEIJING — Exports of elegant Swiss watches to China have plunged. Sales of Mercedes-Benz and other premium sedans are slowing. And high-end restaurants, coming off their worst Chinese New Year festival in years, are starting to change their menus to lure ordinary families.
At a Montblanc shop in downtown Beijing, sales clerks recall the days when they rang up as many as 10 of the top-selling fountain pens every day. And never mind the $1,400 price tag: The platinum-plated pen capped with a half-carat diamond was a particular favorite. Nowadays the store sells one such pen every two to three days, said a saleswoman surnamed Ren, adding sadly that her pay is commission-based.
Such is the state of living large in the world's second-largest luxury market. Yet the cause of the downturn is not economic — it is political.
In the last few months, China's new leader, President Xi Jinping , has been pressing a campaign to rein in the lavish ways of the nation's political and military elite. Warning that corruption could threaten the Communist Party's survival, Xi has waged a highly public effort to rid officialdom of ostentatious living.
Ceremonial red carpets and floral decor are out. Flying coach is in. Party cadres are being told to double up in hotel rooms.
And in what has become a particular crowd pleaser with the public, Beijing is going after those who have long abused the privileges of military license plates, which almost guarantee immunity from traffic laws and other such inconveniences.
It's a much-debated question here whether this wide-ranging campaign is aimed at the root causes of corruption and income inequality, or only addressing the most visible symptoms. Whichever the case, Xi and his lieutenants have good reason for their frugality program.
Beijing has long maintained control in part by tacitly promising that over time everyone will benefit from the country's new wealth. Rampant corruption and the garish displays of affluence by senior officials and their families strike at the heart of Beijing's promise that it is working to make life better for all. Ordinary Chinese, often through microblogs and other social media, have increasingly lashed out at what they see as a privileged class of political elites.
Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese governance at Claremont McKenna College, thinks Xi has two objectives with his anticorruption program: "To appease the Chinese public to show that he has heard their voice … [and] to tell officials throughout the system that the new leadership has absolute authority."
Whatever the government's purpose, the campaign has affected spending on all kinds of high-end goods and services. Some analysts blame Xi's crackdown for China's disappointing economic growth in the first quarter, which has brought financial pain to many workers.
The repercussions of the austerity drive aren't just domestic. Official visits sponsored by government entities to the United States and other countries are rapidly declining, according to travel industry sources. That is sure to be felt by California, a popular destination among the Chinese.
Most purveyors of luxury goods in China are sitting tight for now, betting that the freeze will end soon.
"I still believe that gift-giving, as long as it is not conspicuous, will remain an important behavior in China," said Pierre Coppere, chairman of distiller Pernod Ricard Asia, reassuring analysts recently after a double-digit drop in revenue from sales of Scotch whiskey during the Chinese New Year period.
Gift-giving is a way of life for many Chinese businesses and bureaucrats, as are bribes. Over the years, Communist Party officials have found plenty of ways to pocket gains from land sales, hiring and operation of businesses on the side.
In many cases, the extravagant spending comes from official entertainment funds. Even though the party's manuals spell out standards for purchases in detailed fashion — specifying, for example, the maximum engine size that each level of government can buy for its fleet — the regulations have seldom been enforced.
Civil servants earn modest incomes — no more than $850 a month for a mid-level central government official, some state media reports say — but many have spruced up their lifestyles by traveling first class, dining at premium restaurants and holding lavish ceremonies, all on the taxpayers' dime. Officials charged an estimated $57 billion worth of expenses on about 10 million government-issued credit cards last year, according to Emerging Asia Group, a research firm in Shanghai.
Xi has made examples of officials who have been publicly criticized, fired or prosecuted, mostly at low levels of government, for using taxpayer money on banquets and trips, for example, or keeping a public vehicle for personal use.
It's less clear how effective he has been in going after flagrant cases of corruption in the upper ranks of power, although last week, the deputy head of China's main economic planning agency, Liu Tienan, was dismissed amid allegations that he had colluded with a private business for personal gain.
State-run media reported that in the first quarter of the year, there were more than 3,600 prosecutions of corruption involving $87.5 million. Those numbers put Xi on pace to outdo his predecessor, Hu Jintao , who also sought to clean up the party in his first year in office, in 2003. But the quarterly report didn't break down the cases by levels of government. Though Xi's crusade has already gone on longer and been more sweeping than those of his predecessors, many experts think the frugality fervor won't last. Once the campaign ends, they say, officials who are lying low will probably go back to their old ways.
Beyond that, Xi's actions do little to address what most see as the root of the problem: a lack of public accountability.
"At the end of the day, all this is a charade," said Pei, of Claremont McKenna.
Zhang Ming, a political scientist at People's University in Beijing, said the key was "whether they're willing to set some hard rules and allow independent supervision." So far, he said, "there aren't any signs that the government is planning to bring that kind of change."
Other Chinese scholars are a little more hopeful, saying Xi's campaign is pushing against an endemic political culture and that it will take time for things to change.
During nearly three decades, Lin Zhe, a professor at the Central Party School, had grown accustomed to lavish meals at official meetings, with cigarettes, wine and fruit always on the table. But at a party lunch last month, she said, everybody was served two dishes and a bowl of soup, cafeteria-style. They got little else except for a bottle of mineral water, and were instructed to take the bottle home if not finished.
When the meeting adjourned, Lin wasn't given a sweater or some other souvenir as before, just a stack of reading material. "They told us to empty and clean our plates."
Lin says the frugality campaign's effect on the national economy shows how much China's rapid growth was being fueled by a corruption bubble. Restaurants and other businesses should "improve the quality and grow by competition and development, not by relying on corruption," she said.
The actual effect of political austerity on the Chinese economy is hard to measure. China's catering and hotel business, for example, accounted for just 2% of the economy in 2010, the latest year for which such data are available.
At the same time, the government sector represents a huge consuming force. Roughly 10 million people hold administrative positions at nearly 400,000 central and local government units, with tens of millions more working at public schools, hospitals and state-owned enterprises.
Some officials complain that Xi's campaign, while good for the economy in the long run, is having the opposite effect at the moment, hampering efforts to bolster domestic consumption.
What's more, some have responded to the crackdown by taking their spending underground, with state media citing reports of lavish sauna-bath receptions held in farmyards and officials drinking premium liquor disguised in mineral water bottles.
Even merchants know how to play the game.
At a Gucci shop in Beijing recently, a saleswoman showed off a $1,500 handbag for men, boasting its Florence-made leather imprinted with the brand's double-G logo. Asked whether it would make a good gift for someone in government, she demurred, pointing instead to another model decidedly more understated but nearly as expensive.
"I don't know if this is suitable," she said. "The logo is too obvious."

By Agence France-Presse
Tweet
A group of ex-Nokia employees who quit over the company’s decision to abandon the planned MeeGo operating system in favour of Windows presented their own smartphone on Monday, hoping to rival the sector’s giants.
The Jolla smartphone, which is entirely intuitive and has no buttons, is “a strong candidate” on the mid- to high-range market, the Helsinki-based company said.
The model, which is so far just called Jolla, has a 4.5-inch touch screen and features two different-coloured halves that together make up the phone.
It is to go on sale in the fourth quarter, retailing for 399 euros ($513).
The company is profiling itself as a “different” manufacturer, and runs on its own operating system called Sailfish OS, a successor to MeeGo and which is compatible with some Android applications.
The company is offering Sailfish products to retailer and operator partners for the medium-price range.
According to Marc Dillon, head of Sailfish development, existing operating systems “do not really support a great deal of flexibility. One (iOS) is completely closed and one (Android) pushes its own services pretty heavily.”
“I see that Sailfish will be used on lots of different devices from other manufacturers as well. We have a constant stream of interest,” he told AFP.
Dillon said he would be “very happy with one million sold devices in one year.”
Jolla hopes to take on markets in China, Europe and North Africa, but not the United States.
Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at equity research company Inderes, deemed the new phone’s technical qualities as average but said Jolla’s innovative strategy and moderate pricing may appeal to the public.
“If Jolla manages to sell two million phones in the year following the launch, then we can talk about success,” he said.
Smartphone operating systems are dominated by Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. Jolla’s Sailfish, like Microsoft’s Windows and Mozilla’s Firefox, are trying to break their dominance on the market.
Nordea bank analyst Sami Sarkamies was pessimistic about Jolla’s chances of making it big as a smartphone maker.
However, “the platform (operating system) that they’re developing has a lot more potential,” he said.
Jolla has already signed two distribution deals, with the largest smartphone retailer in China, D.Phone, and the Finnish operator DNA.
The Sailfish OS will also run on tablets.
Jolla, which counts four former Nokia engineers and directors among its five founders, was started in 2011 and now has some 70 employees.

7 Ways to Make Your Business Card Your Best Marketing Tool
Post Comment |
Every day we hand out a tiny brochure about our businesses without even realizing it. Look at the stacks on your desk, the deck in your drawer or the stash in your wallet. Business cards , in all sizes, shapes and colors, are everywhere. And yet, while we all understand that a business card is a necessity, we often fail to see it as a marketing opportunity .
It's time to start seeing that little slip of paper for what it is: the best opportunity you have to market yourself or your business to a targeted and captive audience. After all, you chose to hand it to that person for a reason.
Here are six ways to spiff up your business card so that it collects sales, rather than dust:
1. Give your card a purpose. And we're not just talking communication. Cards that multi-task will be seen far more frequently than your average business card. Turn it into a bookmark, an event ticket, a note card, scratch card or sticker. Make it a conversation piece and your business will automatically become a part of the conversation.
2. Track it. Include a QR code or SKU on your business card, and whenever you hand it out, give the recipient an incentive like discounts or coupons for checking out your site. This way, you'll be able to track the rate at which your card compels people to action. If the current design and incentive doesn't work, you can always try another.

3. Challenge people. Surprise people with a fun fact or figure on your business card. Think about a Trivial-Pursuit-style question or piece of trivia that applies to your business. For example, adding a simple fact -- "You're more likely to survive a plane crash than click on a banner ad" -- could spur a conversation about new marketing channels and strategies, with business owners frustrated by their existing marketing efforts. Engage and amuse people when they read your card and your business will stand out.
4. Add credibility with testimonials. Customers relate to other customers. Because of that, testimonials speak volumes. Consider adding a brief quote or link to a quote on the back of your business card. It's a great way to use valuable space that otherwise goes to waste.
5. Support a cause. Social impact and business go hand-in-hand these days. Let people know about causes that drive you. Use your card as a vehicle to make a difference, and recipients will gain a better understanding of what drives you as a person and a professional. For example, you can include: "Proud supporters of Feeding America."
6. Put a face to the name. Consider putting your photo on your card so that people can continue to put a face to your name long after they've met you. A photo not only adds to the familiarity of your company's brand and increases your likeability factor, but paints a picture of you as a person. It also makes you easily recognizable from your competition.
7. Make the handoff memorable. The physical act of exchanging your card can be more valuable than the card itself. Use it as a conversation starter to better understand where the person's needs, interests or hobbies lie. As you hand out your card, mention when you will follow up and also reinforce a message about the value of your business.
What are your business card tips?

After a market debut marred by technical glitches and a deep dive in the company’s stock price, Facebook has spent the past year focused on its biggest weaknesses: how to make money and keep its more than 1 billion users tethered to the social network.
The results have been mixed. The company’s stock price has recovered some of its worst losses, and Facebook has announced several moneymaking initiatives. But the circumstances surrounding the IPO are still under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and some investors remain unconvinced the social network has staying power.

Apple’s CEO defiant in defense of firm’s tax strategies
Cecilia Kang
Apple CEO Tim Cook offered no apologies at a Senate hearing on his firm’s tactics for avoiding U.S. taxes.
Facebook’s market debut last May was supposed to be the coming-of-age moment for a new generation of tech companies and a surefire bet for the small investor.
Instead, doubts about whether the young company was mature enough to meet shareholders’ demands helped send the company’s shares down from its opening price of $38 per share to a low of $17.55 in August. Although the stock has recovered over the past six months, it’s still about 30 percent below its initial price.
To answer its skeptics, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has focused on developing Facebook’s mobile platform first and ordered mobile-friendly redesigns of just about everything. Facebook’s news feed, the running list of updates from friends, now has bigger pictures, which pop on small screens. And on its smartphone apps, it has increased the size of its photos and made it easier to navigate through friends’ updates with the swipe of a thumb.
It has also tackled a perhaps bigger problem: convincing investors that it can pump up its advertising revenue. Facebook dipped its toe into commerce, allowing retailers to sell gifts to its users through the site. It also introduced new types of ads that allowed advertisers to more directly target users.
The company made 30 percent of its $1.25 billion in ad revenue in the past quarter through mobile ads. Nine months ago, those mobile products didn’t even exist.
The company has “spent the last year catching up to ads in the rest of the industry,” said Forrester Research analyst Nate Elliott. “They’ve done a great job of making their offerings comparable.”
But there is still more to do, Elliott said. The company should make more of its rich social data available outside the confines of its own site, he said.
The flubbed IPO has left a bad taste in the mouths of retail investors, who felt burned by the way the company and bankers handled the deal, said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based securities lawyer.
“The damage done by the Facebook IPO was pretty wide and still reverberates in the market now,” he said. “Most investors who invested in Facebook have not made their money back.”
The botched debut also drew scrutiny from the SEC. The agency is investigating whether Facebook and the underwriters it worked with selectively disclosed information immediately before the IPO about Facebook’s money-making prospects.
The SEC is also probing whether Nasdaq bears responsibility for the technical problems that plagued the exchange when Facebook started trading, costing many firms millions of dollars.
In March, the SEC approved a plan proposed by Nasdaq to pay qualified customers $62 million to make up for the losses. But some firms may seek more.  Switzerland’s UBS AG has said it is taking legal action to get fully reimbursed for its losses, which it had once said totaled more than $350 million.

Uma Swaminathan tuned the television set in the living room of her ranch style home in the suburbs of East Brunswick, N.J. to CNBC. It was 9:00 a.m. on May 18, 2012, a day the retired schoolteacher thought might make her rich. She logged onto her Vanguard brokerage account on her computer and placed an order for 5,000 shares of Facebook at $42 a share.
On TV, wearing his trademark hoodie, 28-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, creator of the world's largest social networking site, stood in the courtyard of Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. A crowd of eager Facebook employees held up company license plates and posters for the cameras. They'd stayed up all night at an employee "hack-a-thon" to celebrate the big day when Facebook was finally going public, in what might have been the most anticipated initial public offering in history. The boyish, blue-eyed Zuckerberg grinned, standing next to Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq-OMX Stock Market, Inc., the largest electronic stock exchange in the United States.
With short hair, brown skin, and few wrinkles, Swaminathan looks much younger than her 68 years. She spent most of adult life as a suburban mom, making tofu for her daughter's friends at theater rehearsals, taking her three sons to soccer practice and Boy Scouts, and volunteering in the local community. She served a term as president of the Indian American Association of New Jersey.
Her interest in the stock market didn't develop until her husband died about 13 years ago. Her four children had already moved out to attend college or to pursue their careers. Swaminathan was left with her late husband's 401(k) retirement account, when she started dabbling in the market, investing in stable companies like Microsoft. Not long after, she began to follow the news coverage of initial public offerings (IPOs) -- when private companies enter the public market -- and came to know of the phenomenon known as the first day "pop." On the day that companies would debut on the stock market, the price would tend to shoot up before stabilizing. A year earlier, she watched as social networking site LinkedIn's stock price closed up 109 percent on its opening day.
She'd never placed such a big bet on just one stock, but she felt a personal connection to Facebook. She had been using the site to connect with family and friends since 2009, and almost everyone she knew had an account.
Now, as she watched the TV in eager anticipation, millions of shares were going to leave the hands of private investors and start trading, giving anyone with enough money a chance to own a slice of the social network giant. Silence descended as Zuckerberg came forward to deliver his speech: "I just want to say a few things, and then we'll ring this bell and we'll get back to work. Right now this all seems like a big deal. Going public is an important milestone in our history. But here's the thing: our mission isn't to be a public company. Our mission is to make the world more open and connected..."
Finally he reached the moment so many were waiting for: "So let's do this!" And the opening bell sounded as he signed the digital screen on the podium before him: "To a more open and connected world," he wrote. His handwritten message instantaneously appeared in Times Square just above the giant illuminated NASDAQ exchange ticker.
Facebook shares hit the market at an opening price of $38. Minutes later, Swaminathan's online order was executed, and the retired schoolteacher had just spent approximately half her life savings.
I: THE OFFERING
For Mark Zuckerberg, selling Facebook shares on the public market had a clear downside. Besides the headache of releasing a company's financial details to the public, he worried that increased scrutiny and push for profits would compromise Facebook's mission.
But like any growth-stage company, Facebook needed money, and private companies face restrictions on how much stock they can issue for cash. In early 2011, Goldman Sachs helped Facebook conjure IPO-type money without an actual IPO by creating a special investment product to sell its private shares to Goldman's wealthiest clients. But when the New York Times exposed the plan, the SEC began to investigate the transaction. Soon after, Zuckerberg decided to take the company public. In late 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook was anticipating an IPO valuation of $100 billion -- nearly four times more than Google's market cap when it went public in 2004.
On February 1, 2012, Facebook filed its Form S-1 -- effectively a birth certificate for publicly traded companies -- containing everything an investor needs to know before buying shares at an IPO, including basic financial information and the business model. Facebook's S-1 showed that the company was primarily in the display-advertising business, with a net profit of $1 billion in 2011 from total revenue of $3.7 billion.
The S-1 is especially meaningful to investment banks. Facebook listed its underwriters -- the banks picked to buy and sell shares on the IPO -- near the front of the document, from left to right, in order of responsibility, with Morgan Stanley in the coveted "left lead" position.
This put Facebook's IPO in the hands of one of Silicon Valley's most celebrated bankers: Michael Grimes, co-head of global technology banking at Morgan Stanley's Menlo Park office, located just a few miles north of Facebook's headquarters.
II: THE BANK
Michael Grimes, the son of a mapmaker, is a lifelong Californian with a bachelor's in computer engineering from UC Berkeley. A titan in the world of tech IPOs, his status grew not only from expertise in taking small and large digital companies public, but also from his myth-making showmanship. To win Ancestry.com's IPO, he created his own family tree and wore a green Hermes tie with leaves to signify the company logo . To get a Hewlett Packard acquisition, he waited outside an executive's office for hours just to make a pitch .
With Grimes and the investment bank prepping the offering and building demand for shares, it fell to another Morgan Stanley employee, Scott Devitt, to tell outside money managers whether they should buy Facebook stock. As the head of Morgan Stanley's Internet equity research team, Devitt makes a 12-month target price for stocks and provides a rating -- buy, hold, or sell -- for hedge funds like Citadel and large, storied institutional investors like Fidelity.  Devitt's agreement with his clients guarantees an independent analysis of company performance -- even if Morgan Stanley is leading the IPO. (Devitt advised clients on whether to buy companies like LinkedIn, Zynga and Pandora while Grimes orchestrated their IPOs.)
The stark division between these two functions of a bank is known as a "Chinese Wall." It forbids investment bankers, like Grimes, from influencing research analysts, like Devitt. Morgan Stanley and other brokerage firms were slammed with fines for repeatedly breaching the "Wall" during the dot-com boom. In the aftermath of the Facebook IPO, the bank would find itself under the spotlight yet again for allegedly sharing key, private information with wealthy clients.
In Facebook's case, the trouble began with a simple revision.
III: THE REVISION
A roadshow -- a city-by-city promotional tour where executives drum up support for their IPO before large investors -- is typically a lackluster affair. Facebook's was more like a Hollywood party.
On May 7, 11 days before the IPO, Facebook management -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg, and CFO David Ebersman -- stepped out of a black SUV in front of the Sheraton Hotel in midtown Manhattan for their first meeting with investors. A crowd of paparazzi greeted them, and a long line of onlookers wound around the hotel building. Inside the meeting, Facebook played a video introducing the business model to special clients of its underwriting banks.
Eleven days before the historic IPO, Morgan Stanley found out Facebook had cut revenue projections -- a nearly unprecedented last-minute correction.
Although an IPO roadshow is supposed to be an untarnished hype-machine for a company's prospects, back in California, those prospects were hurting. Facebook's new internal forecasts showed revenue growing slower than expected. The reason: Users were flocking to smartphones faster than the company could serve mobile ads.
On the first day of what may have been the most watched IPO roadshow in memory, Ebersman confessed to Morgan Stanley that Facebook had cut revenue projections -- a nearly unprecedented last-minute correction in an IPO of its scale. Even if the changes were small, statistically, in IPO showbiz statistics run second to momentum, and nothing kills momentum like a poorly timed downward revision.
Facebook and Morgan Stanley knew they had to make a public disclosure. But what to disclose? The law requires companies to share all information that would likely influence an investor's decision to buy stock. Plus, Morgan Stanley's research team was still advising clients based on figures that Facebook now considered wrong. With less than a week before the IPO, they came up with a solution that they thought would spare Facebook a modicum of embarrassment -- but would have fateful consequences for Morgan Stanley and investors:
• First, Facebook would file an amendment to its public birth certificate, the S-1, to include information about mobile usage cutting into revenue.
• Second, the company would call research analysts with much more specific information about the company's weakening projections.
IV: THE AMENDMENT
When a company makes an amendment to its S-1, the entire document can be filed again, without track-changes or highlights to specify the changes. When Facebook filed its "Amendment No. 6 to Form S-1" to disclose its ongoing challenge to serve ads to mobile users, changes were embedded on three pages of the 170-page document.
On page 14 and 17, the company said that its users were growing faster than ads due to the increased use of mobile phones and product decisions that allowed fewer ads per page. On page 57, Facebook said the mobile trend discussed elsewhere in the document had continued in the second quarter, due to users shifting from computers to phones. None of the changes suggested any major revision to Facebook's financial outlook.
Facebook's lowered revenue estimates did not appear in the S-1, nor was there any precedent requiring these numbers to be included. Even the most sophisticated retail investors, armed with a software bot that could comb the new S-1 for updates, could not have read what research analysts at Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and many other investment banks would learn later that evening: That Facebook, already projected to trade at high multiples given its earnings figures, was slashing its annual projections.
V: THE CALL
Before an IPO of Facebook's size, research analysts and large investors play a massive multi-billion-dollar game of "Telephone," because analysts at underwriting firms are banned from publishing or emailing research about a new public company until 40 days after the IPO. The rule is designed to protect retail investors from taking analysts' notoriously bullish research too seriously. But it has an unintended side effect: Research analysts can pass on exclusive, last-minute information to institutional clients without a paper trail.
And Facebook's last-minute revelation was about to launch a historic game of "Telephone."
After the company's surprising eleventh-hour amendment, the unenviable job of explaining Facebook's revisions to the research analysts fell to Cipora Herman, Facebook's vice president of finance. On May 9, Herman and Michael Grimes huddled in a Philadelphia hotel for a rehearsal session. He played the part of an analyst, while she played herself. They practiced until the amended S-1 was officially made public on the SEC website, at exactly 5:03pm.
In its revised S-1, Facebook told the public that mobile ads presented an ongoing challenge. In calls that night to research analysts, the company said much more.
Before her first call to Scott Devitt at Morgan Stanley, Grimes left the room to avoid the appearance of breaking the law that bans investment bankers from influencing analysts. "I was far down the hall so I wouldn't hear anything," he testified in a Massachusetts suit brought against Morgan Stanley. "I took extra precaution to do that, and sat on the floor."
But Herman had a script in Grimes' handwriting detailing Facebook's new second-quarter revenue estimates:
"I wanted to make sure you saw the disclosure we made in our amended filing. The upshot of this is that we believe we are going to come in the lower end of our $1.1 to $1.2 bn range for Q2 based upon the trends we described in the disclosure."
The script also showed that Herman had added Facebook's year-end estimates:
"Trend/headwinds over the next six to nine months as this run through the rest of the year, this could be 3 to 3 and a half percent off the 2012 $5 billion target."
Herman's first three calls were to the research desks of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, and after their conversations, all three banks cut their estimates of Facebook's annual revenue by between 3.01% and 3.33% --
perfectly aligned with Herman's notes, as the following charts from court documents show:
The news spread -- from research analysts to their preferred clients -- that Facebook was slashing revenue estimates in the middle of the roadshow. Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs had effectively sounded alarm bells on Wall Street. Even analysts who hadn't yet made a single call about Facebook's new figures were being inundated with questions. "Our clients were asking us to confirm what they had heard, so we had to tell them what we knew," said a research analyst at one of the other underwriting firms.
Many large investors sensed a rare opportunity: With its revenue projections falling at such a peculiar time, the conditions could be perfect to place a massive bet against Facebook stock.
VI: THE BET
A week before the IPO, confusion reigned in the financial press.
On May 11, Bloomberg reported that demand for Facebook's stock among institutional investors was much lower than expected. But on the same day, Reuters had a conflicting report: Facebook was already oversubscribed, and one large unnamed institutional investor was calling around syndicate desks trying to get more shares.
While retail investors clamored for Facebook shares, some large investors were planning a massive short -- essentially betting against the stock's buyers. Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of Tampa-based research firm IPO Boutique, received calls from hedge fund clients saying they heard from research analysts at underwriting banks that Facebook's mobile trend was behind its lowered earnings estimates. One multi-billion dollar hedge fund client told Sweet that he planned to short the stock as a result. (Sweet didn't name the investor due to a confidentiality agreement he has with clients.)
"The consensus among hedge funds on the West Coast was to short the stock on day one."
"The consensus among hedge funds on the West Coast was to short the stock on day one," said one institutional investor at a medium-sized hedge fund specializing in technology stocks. "The call we received from JP Morgan about earnings being lighter than expected gave us even more conviction in our short." Hedge fund analysts at his firm were receiving calls from their personal brokers days before the IPO, hawking an allegedly rare chance to get shares of Facebook stock. "That never happens," the hedge fund investor said. "Supply was definitely exceeding demand."
But despite the growing consensus among some large investors that Facebook was overpriced, on May 15, three days before Facebook's market debut, the underwriting banks increased the IPO range from $28-$35 to $35-$38, citing heavy demand. A day later, they increased supply to more than 420 million shares.
The new share and price allocation placed Facebook's valuation at the iconic $100 billion mark.
VII: THE GLITCH
Back in her home, Swaminathan didn't know about the reduced revenue estimates or about the vast number of hedge funds that were planning to short Facebook. After the opening bell ceremony neared its end at 9:30 a.m., she was still watching CNBC waiting for the stock to begin its scheduled trading at 11:00 a.m. "We are witnessing a lot of American wealth getting generated as we speak," said a CNBC reporter. "After years of people taking risks, dealing with uncertainty, unknowns, rivals, this is the pay-off."
"Awaiting Facebook's opening trade" showed in a breaking news box on the bottom of the screen, while an unchanged $38 opening price appeared on a split screen in anticipation of 11:00 a.m. Minutes later, Swaminathan, eager for the stock to open, called her son, who lives in New York City, to inform him about the 5,000 shares she had ordered. She had placed a buy limit order, a conditional transaction to purchase shares at a specified price -- $42 in her case -- or lower.
Her son, who studied finance at UC Berkeley, was livid. "Cancel the order immediately," he told his mother. "Cancel it! Cancel it!" Around 9:45 a.m., she hit the icon on her trading screen to cancel the order and then resumed watching TV. At 11:00 a.m., CNBC announced that Facebook's opening was delayed until 11:05 a.m. In all the times she had seen IPOs on television, Swaminathan had never witnessed a market delay on the opening day. Something is wrong, she thought.
She turned her attention to her computer screen only to realize that there was no sign of her having voided the order. She kept refreshing the page in hopes of seeing the notification. When no cancellation report appeared, she called her stockbroker at Vanguard. "What's going on?" she asked.
If the cancel order was placed, then it's probably cancelled, the broker told her. She got off the phone and went back to her computer screen. There was no sign of cancellation. She called Vanguard again. This time, she says, she waited on the line for a long time, but no one came to take her call.
Meanwhile, Facebook stock opened at 11:30 a.m. The mysterious delay was due to technical glitches. NASDAQ's electronic trading platform couldn't handle the high volume of trades. In the first 30 seconds, around 82 million shares were exchanged.
Facebook did not experience the anticipated pop. The stock reached a high of around $45 per share. At 4:00 p.m., when the market closed, the stock was priced at $38.23, only 23 cents more than its opening price.
Later that day, the Wall Street Journal reported that Morgan Stanley had stepped in to stabilize the stock, using what is referred to in finance as a "greenshoe option" -- a common stipulation in the IPO agreement that lets underwriting banks sell more shares to investors than they are allotted. The mechanism lets banks buy back the shares at the offering price, in case the company's stock price needs a little help on the first day. The buying action puts upward pressure on the stock.
Her son came to New Jersey to stay with her over the weekend. For two days, they quarreled. He wanted to know why she put so much money into one stock, and she couldn't give him a satisfying answer. "He kept asking me what was going through my head when I bought the shares," she recounts.
On Monday morning, she called Vanguard. "Was my purchase cancelled?" she asked. The answer finally came: No, the broker told her, Vanguard had purchased 5,000 shares on her behalf at a price of $41.25, meaning about $206,000 from her retirement account was spent to acquire her stake.
On that second day of trading, Facebook closed at $34.03. Swaminathan had lost, on paper, about $36,000. Her son advised her to hold onto her shares until she either resolved the matter with Vanguard or the price bounced back.
VIII: THE AFTERMATH
The next couple days were a blur. Swaminathan approached Vanguard again, asking why the cancel order wasn't processed.  She could have sold the shares before the price plummeted, she said to the broker, asking to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor blamed NASDAQ and said they would notify the exchange about the incident. When she called a day later, Vanguard declared it a legitimate purchase. There was nothing that could be done for her.
In the meantime, she tuned into CNBC to watch coverage of the IPO's aftermath. When news started rolling in about class action lawsuits filed against Morgan Stanley and Facebook for selective disclosure, she was stunned. Institutional investors received warnings about lower revenue estimates before the opening day, CNBC reported. (Some of these class-action lawsuits are still ongoing.)
Swaminathan wasn't keen on using the court system. She had already lost money and was wary about losing more to legal expenses. But in June, one lawyer told her about the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA) -- a private corporation that acts as a self-regulatory body among securities firms, such as banks. She believed the agency had a way for her to seek restitution without the complexities of a formal lawsuit. FINRA offered a way for her to air her grievances without a hefty legal fee, and the organization's stated goal is to protect investors -- investors like her, she thought.
She quickly wrote a typo-riddled complaint, laying out her misgivings against Facebook, Morgan Stanley, NASDAQ and her brokerage firm Vanguard, to FINRA. It was a two-page explanation of what happened on the day of the IPO.  "I was caught up in the Facebook IPO hype and thought that this would be a good investment and practically put all my retirement money in this stock purchase," she wrote in the complaint. She said Vanguard failed to inform her of the status of her trade, blamed NASDAQ, and then retracted responsibility to say her trade was a proper execution. She complained that "only certain customers, mostly big institutions and hedge funds" could file claims with NASDAQ about the trading glitches.
She also jotted down the expected reparation: $105,000 for compensatory damages, $500,000 for punitive damages, $1 million for "pain and suffering" and $315,000 in damages related to fraud. "I feel jilted and my confidence is now permanently stricken," she said in the complaint. FINRA will be on my side, she thought, as she told her story to the regulatory body.
IX: THE HEADLINES
On July 16, FINRA sent Swaminathan a letter: Neither Facebook nor NASDAQ was a member of their organization, and it lacked the authority to call them in. Still, she was willing to arbitrate with Morgan Stanley and Vanguard.
But in November, a response came from Morgan Stanley in the form of a lawsuit: Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC v. Swaminathan. The bank had essentially filed an injunction to stop the arbitration from happening, requesting that Swaminathan pay legal fees incurred if it is required to participate in arbitration. When Swaminathan read the court documents, she panicked. "They wanted to take what I had left," she cried.
Then she saw the headlines.
Reuters based a story on Morgan Stanley's complaint, entitled, "Morgan Stanley seeks to halt Facebook arbitration case." Gizmodo.com wrote, "A Sad Woman Lost Her Entire Life Savings in the Facebook IPO and Now Wants Her Money Back." Business Insider had " There Actually Is A Widow Who Says She Lost Her Life Savings In The Facebook IPO."
She was mortified. "Whatever happened to confidentiality?" she exclaimed. "FINRA had promised that my documents would stay private." Indeed, her complaint might have stayed private if it went unsettled (FINRA makes awards and judgments public on its website). But Morgan Stanley made her papers available to the press when it attached them to a countersuit filed through New York's public court system.
She eventually withdrew her claims against both the bank and Vanguard. "I just couldn't deal with the stress anymore," she said. "I guess the big guy always wins."
X: THE LOSS
An American flag hangs in front of the JPMorgan Chase tower in midtown Manhattan. In early May, rivaling its height was another banner with a Facebook IPO logo. Business journalist Heidi Moore shared a photograph of the building's façade with her Twitter followers on May 4. Radio reporter Ben Bergman retweeted it with a comment: "In Facebook We Trust."
By Aug. 18, Facebook lost about $50 billion in value. But many big investors made huge profits betting against the company.
By Aug. 18, Facebook lost about $50 billion in value. But many big investors made huge profits betting against the company, and others avoided major losses by backing out of the IPO just in time. During the roadshow, Capital Group, a large mutual fund and one of Morgan Stanley's preferred clients, pulled out of the deal after initially showing interest, and many other funds followed suit, according to a research analyst who was in correspondence with investors. SAC Capital Advisors, Steven Cohen's $14 billion dollar hedge fund and another one of Morgan Stanley's prominent clients, took a sizeable short position in the stock, said a research analyst. Scott Sweet's multi-billion dollar hedge fund client flipped the stock at $42. His subsequent short made his firm its "largest profit of the year," Sweet said. There's "no way" a retail investor could have known about the lowered projections, unless he or she "had a friend at a multi-billion dollar institution," he added.
A few days after Facebook debuted, Massachusetts's regulator William Galvin issued a subpoena to Morgan Stanley as part of an investigation into research analysts communicating Facebook's revenue prospects to certain institutional investors. Seven months later, Galvin's office settled with Morgan Stanley for $5 million after charging its investment banking division with inappropriately influencing research analysts during Facebook's IPO roadshow -- essentially breaching the "Chinese Wall." When asked about the script he wrote for Facebook's vice president of finance, Grimes testified, "I don't remember if she had a script or not."
Facebook, Vanguard, and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on all the claims in this story.
Swaminathan held onto her shares and went to her birth city of Chennai, India. She's writing two books -- one about herbs and spices and another about New Jersey's public school system. She hasn't traded stocks in a while, but she checks Facebook's stock price every few days hoping that someday it will bounce back.
Saturday, May 18, marked the one-year anniversary of the IPO. Facebook's shares closed Friday at $26.25 -- exactly $15 below her purchase price.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-19/gold-bear-bets-reach-record-as-soros-cuts-holdings-commodities.html|Gold Bear Bets Reach Record as Soros Cuts Holdings: Commodities
By Joe Richter - 2013-05-20T20:01:28Z
Hedge-fund managers are making the biggest ever bet against gold as billionaire George Soros sold holdings last quarter and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted more declines after the longest slump in four years.
The funds and other large speculators held 74,432 so-called short contracts on May 14, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. That’s the highest since the data begins in June 2006 and compares with 67,374 a week earlier. The net-long position dropped 20 percent to 39,216 futures and options, the lowest since July 2007. Net-bullish wagers across 18 U.S.- traded raw materials rose 1.1 percent to 588,482, led by gains in hogs, corn and cotton.
Gold prices that surged sixfold in the past 12 years fell 17 percent in 2013, including a seven-session slump through May 17 that was the longest since March 2009. Soros joined funds managed by Northern Trust Corp. and BlackRock Inc. in cutting holdings of exchange-traded products in the first quarter. ETP assets are now at the lowest since July 2011 after some investors lost faith in gold as a store of value amid improving economic growth, low inflation and a rally in equities .
“Gold has faced disappointment after disappointment,” said John Stephenson , a senior vice president and fund manager who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.65 billion) at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. “It’s had a 12-year run, but the whole fear-mongering that the world is going to end is just not working. So, I think that any last vestige of an investment thesis for gold has been stripped.”
Prices Slump
Gold futures fell 5 percent to $1,364.70 an ounce on Comex in New York last week. Prices slumped as Federal Reserve regional bank presidents including Richard Fisher of Dallas and Charles Plosser of Philadelphia called for a reduction of U.S. monetary stimulus. Fisher and Plosser don’t hold a policy vote this year. Seventeen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect bullion to fall this week, with eight bullish and three neutral.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities climbed 0.4 percent last week, and the MSCI All-Country World of equities gained 1 percent. The dollar rallied 1.3 against a basket of six major currencies. A Bank of America Corp. Index shows Treasuries lost 0.2 percent. Gold futures for June delivery climbed 1.4 percent to settle at $1,384.10 today.
Soros, Paulson
Soros Fund Management LLC lowered its investment in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion ETP, by 12 percent to 530,900 shares as of March 31, compared with three months earlier, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed May 15. The reduction followed a 55 percent cut in the fourth quarter last year. Paulson & Co., the top investor in the SPDR fund, maintained a stake of 21.8 million shares, now valued at $2.86 billion. Global ETP holdings slid 16 percent to 2,198.3 metric tons this year, valued at $95.7 billion.
Gold’s slump “has been faster than we expected,” Goldman analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a May 14 report. A further drop in ETP holdings would “continue to precipitate this decline,” said the analysts, who forecast prices at $1,390 in 12 months. The metal will get “crushed” and trade at $1,100 in a year and below $1,000 in five years as inflation fails to accelerate, Ric Deverell, the head of commodities research at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in London on May 16.
Physical buying will help to support prices, said Paul Dietrich, the chief executive officer of Middleburg, Virginia-based Fairfax Global Markets, which oversees about $120 million.
India Premiums
Gold premiums in India , the world’s biggest buyer, more than doubled to $40 an ounce May 15 from $17 to $18 a day earlier, according to Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director at the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation. China ’s bullion demand jumped to a record 294.3 tons in the first quarter, the World Gold Council said in a report May 16.
Prices surged 53 percent since the end of 2008 as central banks printed money on an unprecedented scale to boost growth. The Federal Reserve is buying $85 billion of assets a month to stimulate the world’s biggest economy, while Japan is making monthly bond purchases of more than 7 trillion yen ($67.8 billion).
“The case for gold is still there,” Dietrich said. “All the central banks are joining in a massive printing of money. Physical demand may be helping provide a floor on prices, and while there’s not a lot of downside risk right now to gold, there is a lot of upside potential.”
Record Equities
Bullion fell in six of the past seven months. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) of equities reached a record May 17 as the dollar climbed to the highest since July 2010 against six major currencies. The U.S. consumer-price index fell for a second month in April, government data showed May 16, and expectations for cost increases, as measured by the break-even rate for 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, reached the lowest since August the next day.
Money managers withdrew $883 million from gold funds in the week ended May 15, according to Cameron Brandt , the director of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Total outflows from commodity funds were $1.15 billion, according to EPFR.
Raw materials are returning to a “normal state” from a “super cycle” for prices that saw “abnormal strength” in returns, Goldman said in the May 14 report. Returns for commodities as gauged by the S&P GSCI Enhanced Index will be 1.6 percent over 12 months. That’s down from an April 23 forecast of 2.5 percent.
Copper, Silver
Investors increased their bets on a rally for crude oil for a third week to 205,140 futures and options, the CFTC data show. The funds decreased wagers on declines for copper to 13,115 short contracts from 16,798 a week earlier. Silver holdings tumbled 72 percent to 1,413, the lowest since speculators were net-short on April 9.
A measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products jumped 15 percent to 270,486 contracts, the highest since March. Wagers on a corn rally increased 23 percent to 75,632 futures and options, a third straight gain. Cotton holdings rose the most since January.
Cotton prices climbed 15 percent this year, the biggest gain after natural gas among the 24 commodities tracked by S&P. Dry weather will extend a drought pattern through May 22 in West Texas, the top U.S. growing region, MDA Information Systems Inc. said May 17. U.S. production will fall 19 percent this year, the Department of Agriculture said May 10.
“Everything in the agricultural space depends on weather,” said Paul Christopher, the chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC in St. Louis , which helps manage $1.3 trillion. “There’s definitely a high probability of more pain to come in gold. If the dollar can continue to gain on the yen, I think we’ll continue to see people sell out of gold and look for the dollar or U.S. stocks.”

The problem with the “follow your passion” chorus: We can’t all love the products we work with. Someone has to do the jobs and sell the things that don’t seem sexy but make the world go round.
It’s something we’ve seen in our Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Proud series. Braintree processes credit cards. You won’t meet too many people who claim to “love” credit card processing. Even Braintree’s Bryan Johnson admits, “I’m not particularly passionate about payments, but I am passionate about trying to build a good company.” Johnson gets satisfaction from making customers happy, creating a workplace that employees enjoy, and improving  “an unscrupulous and broken industry.”
InsuranceAgents.com sells insurance. Again, it’s tough to find anyone with a “passion” for insurance. Seth Kravitz of InsuranceAgents.com says, “Insurance is not an exciting industry, but that doesn’t mean the work can’t be meaningful. We had to find ways to make the work more fun, make the environment more family like, and show people the positive impact of what they do.”
Both these companies have succeeded by dropping the “follow your passion” idea and focusing instead on process.
The problems with passion
Part of this is recognizing that, despite its wonders, there are also problems with passion. For one thing, most people’s passions aren’t that unique. That’s why it’s so hard to succeed in the restaurant business or as a professional dancer; You’re competing against everyone else with that same dream.
Also, turning a passion into a business is a good way to kill the passion. You might love music. But become a music critic and you’re going to have to listen to hundreds of albums every month. Including a lot of stuff you hate. By the end of it, you might just discover that you can’t stand the thing you used to love. Kravitz says, “I love reading books, but I would hate to be a book reviewer. What you love to do in your personal life, many times doesn’t translate well into a business.”
How not what
So does this mean we’re all doomed to a life of ditch digging drudgery? No. It’s about redefining passion. Instead of working with a thing you love, think about how to work in a way you love.
It’s something Amy Hoy talks about in Don’t Follow Your Passion . Here’s her take on The Cute Little Café Syndrome:
If you want to run a successful café — and enjoy it — you need to love a lot more than coffee. You’ve also gotta get some kind of pleasure, even grim satisfaction, out of the daily grind. (Ha ha.) Which means, of course, interacting with customers, hiring & managing wait staff, handling the day-to-day necessities like ordering supplies, cleaning, paying rent, marketing your butt off, and dealing with customers who want to squat on your valuable tables all day for just $2 of brew.
Take your cues from this “daily grind” example and how companies like Braintree and InsuranceAgents.com succeed. Find meaning in what you’re doing. Work to improve your industry. Get joy from making a customer’s day. Surround yourself with the kinds of people and environment that keep you engaged. Figure out the details and day-to-day process that keep you stimulated. Focus on how you execute and making continual improvements. Get off on how you sell, not what you sell.
It might not be the romantic ideal of “passion.” But if it provides you with sustainable joy and profit that you can count on, you’ll still be way ahead of the curve (and have extra resources and free time to spend doing whatever you want).

I agree about thinking about the way you’ll be working. My business partner and I started by defining the way we wanted our next venture to work before we knew what it was. It shouldn’t require employees, offices or a lot of overhead. Travel is increasingly important to me so the ability to work from anywhere was also important. With these criteria in place we evaluated several ideas and only one supported these ‘workstyle’ choices. And that idea has turned out to be the most enjoyable business experience I’ve had (we’re not making money yet but…). It was also the simplest of our choices. Recently Mike, my co-founder, decided to move across the country for a job his wife was offered. Without these choices and criteria this could have been a dealbreaker. Instead it is really not an issue at all.
Brandon 10 May 11
Thank you for this great advice.  I have so frequently started building applications and given up because my passion waned.  I have begun to realize that my passion must be more than code, but seeing the end result, making a difference in the lives of my customers.  I really appreciate this article for the brutal, yet all important truth.
AkitaOnRails 10 May 11
Thank you for this article! Many developers follow SvN and because of lack of experience they follow what you say to the letter. That’s very bad because one get a feel for something too idealized, too utopic. I do understand that the whole point is the pursue. There is indeed no point in doing something unless you pursue the very best. But this is a path not a starting point and many developers think they they “deserve” to have a utopic starting poing from the very beginning and refuse to do good work unless they have the “perfect” environment. And what is difficult for me is trying to persuade people that we shouldn’t wait for the ideal to just magically show up, and that we have to pursue and build it. And this path is usually not pretty, we will eventually have to do some “dirty work” to clean up the way. You would help a lot writing more about this worthiness of the pursue efforts and how things don’t start “perfect” and how we make efforts to make a business work.

A wise man I know said something to this effect about passion: You’re not born with passion. Passion comes from working really hard at something, getting really good at it and seeing the beauty in it. I think this wisdom also applies to a person you “love.” Love is something that sort of just happens and you know it when you feel it, but passion…you need beauty to fuel passion and as with all things truly beautiful, its not skin deep.

Cal Newport writes a blog (study hacks) and has spent a good deal of time thinking and writing on this subject. You can find the most relevant posts on this topic @ his blog under the heading: Rethinking Passion.
Here is a link to one of the first posts I read on his blog. It grabbed me and I have been a committed reader of his blogs and books since.
http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/10/16/the-passion-trap-how-the-search-for-your-lifes-work-is-making-your-working-life-miserable/
In his book, How To Be A High School Superstar, he invites us to toss out the concept of passion and replace it with something he calls “interestingness”. He spends some time fleshing this concept out so I will not try to diminish the power of his point by trying to summarize it here. One thing I will share is a comment that he makes that is particularly relevant given Matt’s post (and the various comments). It  is not the activity that matters, he asserts, but rather the effect that activity has on your personality.

Nice post, Matt. To be honest, I can’t stand hearing everyone talk about their passion. It’s goofy. The people who have so much “passion” are also the ones who seem to change their life around all the time (new jobs, new hobbies, new spouses). They are certainly passionate right up to the point where they flame out with a trail of disaster behind them.
Just focus on doing things well.
Brian M. 10 May 11
Excellent article!  I work in healthcare, and it can be boring and dull.  Instead of seeking my passion, instead, I focused on redefining what I was passionate about in my job.
I changed the way I thought about my day-to-day, so I focused on improving customer service, then improving the way we deployed and tested software, even going so far as to helping others learn new things at work (I ended up creating a QA position out of my corporate trainer!).
It really does make things more meaningful when you focus on the work. Work is going to be prevalent until I retire or die, so while I’m still working for my hospital, I made my own mission statement on how I am able to fulfill the mission statement of the hospital.  This alone has put me on the radar of several big wigs…so yeah, there are benefits. :)

Being forced to do something as your livelihood is not nearly as much fun as just doing it when and where you want to.

Interesting twist on the usual “do what you love” mantra… this is something I’ve struggled with in the past couple years, as I moved from a couple jobs where I was interested in what the companies sold (computers/electronics, modern lighting) to one in which I am not (retirement communities, RV campgounds). In addition to a more stable company during the worst of the economic downturn, I was also lured by the prospect of explore some of those areas of my craft I had hoped to. Sadly, however, that hasn’t come to fruition as we continue to maintain/update out of date sites rather than build new ones or explore new platforms like mobile.

Hmm… I don’t want to be mean, rather I felt that you needed some extreme criticism to continue your success into the future. I think this (meaning this post and all that’s related to it) is one of the 37 signals that’s indicating that 37signals is going downhill, and aiming for short-term success. I can list a few more if you want me to.
I guess what you are trying to say is that, we (meaning everyone down the ladder from the  CEO ) should all be like sissies. I don’t agree one bit, although I have followed this dictum myself for several years, I can attest to the fact that it not a charming way of life. It is simply a life not worth living.
When work is just work, it always sub-standard (no matter how much artificial enthusiasm you imbibe into it). No wonder, we are surrounded my mostly sub-standard things. If Edgar Alan Poe was not passionate about what what he wrote, well, you know what you would be reading right now (though that would have ensured that his grand-chindren would be filthy rich).
I think you guys are getting greedy.
A lot of people here have mentioned your great customer support, but why have you been hiring more and more customer support people? Is that going to ensure better customer support? If your developers can’t do customer support well, you have already shot yourself in the foot by hiring such people. Don’t you remember the days when you not only did development, but also passionately did customer support? Wasn’t that what made you into what you are now today.

I can’t help but feel this is a rationalization.  You shouldn’t necessarily make your passion your job but you shouldn’t just take hold of any industry because your enjoy the process of building something.  Your work should at least be somewhat in line with what you enjoy in the rest of your life.  If you’re a programmer who passion is art you’ll be hard pressed not to feel a little bit empty spending 8+ hours of your day a site designed to help people find insurance.
deb lavoy 12 May 11
I have a slightly different take on this. I think passion comes from a feeling of knowing what you do is making a difference, has an impact, a purpose. Typing all day is not interesting, not something I’m passionate about. Insurance may not be sexy – but it makes families more secure, children healthier, etc – manual labor may not be a labor of passion, but connecting the country with a railroad is… In other words, making sure that what we do is for a meaningful purpose makes the work more of a pleasure than a grind.

Isaac Asimov summarized this best, by describing how after Phd’ing in chemistry he went on to write more books on astronomy. Why? He knew “too much about chemistry to get excited about it..”

I agree with Brian M. I just try to do things better when I can.

I think if want to have passion for something, when doing a service, you need to have passion for serving. That’s the kind of passion that moves you without being too passionately  utopic.

I started to run an online shop with Moleskine notebooks and started to hate them :) Seriously! I stopped. I am a big fan of stationery again.
I’m passionate about marketing and building e-commerce platforms. I sell boring products like  SSL  Certificates to clients in an easy way. Security made simple. I am excited about ROIs, conversions, investments in marketing etc. and the outcomes it brings. I’m excited about measuring success rate and bringing the best customer service. I don’t love products, but I am passionate about making clients happy.
My pure passion and interests goes on my blog where I write about creativity and marketing. No timeframes, deadlines and goals. I just write when I want. Period.

Great post – the comments are really interesting and possibly highlight something about your process vs passion idea:
I think it really depends on the type of person you are and what drives you. For instance I know many people that have a real passion for something, whether it be web design, or film production, or music. These people, because they are so passionate about these things, tend to want to do that thing without really thinking about where the payday is. Like you highlighted, there’s often lots of others interested in these industries so it’s already an uphill struggle to make it pay well. In other word these people get blinded by the passion of the task itself i.e. designing the website or producing the film for a client.
The other types of people are more likely to be driven by something else such as money, or fame, or success rather than the pastime itself. In it’s purest form you might see this as a bad thing but it actually lets you assess an opportunity more objectively than if you are blinded by the idea of actually doing something that ‘you like’. You mentioned the idea of card processing and I think that’s a good example – not particularly exciting but it’s an opportunity and one that might be missed by someone vocation driven rather than results driven.

http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/20/us-food-delivery-giants-seamless-and-grubhub-officially-announce-merger/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)|Send anonymous tip
Seamless and GrubHub, two of the largest online food delivery services in the US, have officially announced “the signing of a definitive agreement” to merge into a combined company.
This news, which confirms earlier reports  that the two companies were in talks, follows more than nine years of heavy competition. If the deal goes through, GrubHub founder Matt Maloney will take the reins of the new company and current Seamless CEO Jonathan Zabusky will serve as president.
As for what the new firm will be called, the official release states that “the combined organization’s name and marketing brands are expected to be determined following regulatory approval.” Given that “Seamless” — once called SeamlessWeb during the dot com boom — is a confusingly ambiguous name for a site that enables food ordering, it wouldn’t surprise us if revisions were made.
New stats were also shared in the announcement, including that the two companies facilitated approximately $875 million in gross food sales to local businesses. This apparently resulted in over $100 million in combined revenue.
In the announcement, both companies claim that merging will lead to “accelerated innovation” and “enhanced financial flexibility.” The latter statement may be true, but considering the companies’ relationship up until now — they historically fought aggressively for the same customers — we’re betting a sudden decline in competition won’t help customers in the long-run. As stated above, the merger is still subject to regulatory approval.
As for what’s left of the competitive food delivery space, companies like Delivery.com , Eat24  and the decentralized Ordr.in remain.

CEOs Say Investing In Innovation Is Not Paying Off
'Moving the needle' is one of those omnipresent business cliches that are used so frequently we tend to tune them out.
In the work context it means making an investment or taking an action that changes an enterprises' fortunes. By which, those who use it usually mean raising the stock price, improving earnings, creating strategic advantage and, just in case we weren't clear about most executives' priorities these days, raising the stock price.
So when a consulting firm like Accenture - which makes its quite substantial living from pleasing the CEOs of many large corporations - reports that said CEOs are concerned about the low impact of innovation investments, we should pay attention. We should also ask a lot of questions.
The first question is what they mean by 'not paying off.' CEOs and the companies they manage are evaluated on a range of metrics. Some of them fairly reflect the KPIs - key performance indicators - that it takes to really run that business. But some of them, again, to be fair, are designed to assure that senior executives are compensated in the manner to which they have become accustomed.
What this means is that investments in anything - an acquisition, opening a foreign market, new product development - are evaluated with an eye to the long term prospects, but more importantly, whether they will 'move the needle' in the short term. And we do mean short. So if said investment, as in innovation, is not producing returns consistent with hurdle rates meant to emphasize near over far, or bonus calculations tied to this year's payout versus that in five years, it is appropriate to wonder whether the measures being used are reasonable or whether they reflect a bias designed to support a certain outcome.
Now one might also ask why, if all those smart, well-compensated people are investing in innovations that aren't paying off, what assumptions did they make that led them to make the choices they did. And what, by the way, do they mean by innovation? Is it shiny new devices that cause the business press to ooh and ahh. Or is it the less glamorous but potentially more profitable investments in processes, procedures and systems?
When my colleagues and I did a survey of attitudes about corporate innovation, our results showed that most CEOs thought that innovation was one of the terms that defined their enterprise in the eyes of customers and investors. But a concurrent survey of said customers and investors reported that innovation often didnt make it onto their priority list of considerations for purchasing from that company. If it did, it sometimes ranked lower than attributes like 'low cost producer,' or 'convenient.'
The point is that innovation has become so popular a concept that everyone thinks they have to be 'innovative' even when the market does not reward that activity with any sort of premium. Because the market often takes innovation for granted. So when CEOs say they are disappointed in the returns on innovation investment, it may well be because they are investing in the wrong innovation at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons. JL
Bernhard Warner reports in BusinessWeek:
Fewer than one in five chief executives believes his strategic investments in  innovation are paying off, and that this poor track record is starting to  discourage companies from taking risks.
By now it is almost gospel that investing in innovative new products and  services helps a company’s long-term success. That doesn’t mean it’s easy.
For the study “Why ‘Low Risk’ Innovation Is Costly,” , Accenture ( ACN ) surveyed 519 companies across more than 12  industry sectors in France, Britain, and the U.S. Half (51 percent) of survey  respondents reported they had recently increased funding for innovation at their  companies. Almost all (93 percent) said the long-term success of their  organization’s business strategy depends on their ability to innovate.
Despite the importance they assign to this innovate-or-die business  rationale, just 18 percent of CEOs say they’re seeing their investments in  innovation pay off. At the same time, 46 percent of the executives surveyed said  their company had become more risk averse when considering new breakthrough  ideas, the study found.
There may be a classic negative feedback loop at work here. If frustrated  CEOs are not seeing their more risky R&D investments produce needle-moving  results fast enough, they may turn to incremental improvements rather than big  killer ideas. To wit, nearly two out of three of respondents said they were  investing in product-line extensions. And 33 percent said that when it comes to  innovation, “their primary goal was the expansion of the product suites that  support their basic offerings.” That’s fine, but it’s the kind of innovation  that begets the donut  burger , not the risk-taking that can really change a company’s  future.

The recent rise in shareholder-friendly corporate activity is being lauded as one of the most important catalysts in the ongoing rally of many stock markets. But the trend that has companies showering equity investors with a steady stream of share buybacks and dividend increases is giving bondholders another headache.
“While not always immediately credit negative, shareholder-friendly initiatives are typically to the detriment of bondholders,” said Altaf Nanji, a credit analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “All good things must come to an end and, in this case, the cocktail is no longer as enticing for credit investors as it once was.”
In the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, bondholders — already enjoying almost two decades of favourable returns – benefited from an extremely risk-averse environment on the capital markets. Stocks were largely ignored and corporations focused on cleansing their balance sheets and stockpiling cash.
While not always immediately credit negative, shareholder-friendly initiatives are typically to the detriment of bondholders
More recently, however, many companies, buoyed by improving economic conditions, rising stock markets and ultra-low interest rates, have decided to return something extra to equity investors. Activity on this front has been global in scope, but perhaps most pronounced in the United States, where recent examples include aggressive dividend increases and/or share buybacks at Home Depot Inc., AT&T Inc., Nike Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Apple Inc., which announced its first-ever share repurchase plan in April.
Barry Knapp, a strategist at Barclay’s Capital, this week noted that authorized repurchase programs announced during the first-quarter earnings season south of the border were up US$250-billion on the US$1.1-trillion announced a year earlier.
He said buybacks are responsible for roughly 40% of the S&P 500’s earnings growth in the past 12 months, and expects the so-called de-equitization of stock markets through repurchases to continue until corporate fundamentals deteriorate or the U.S. Federal Reserve changes directions on its zero interest rate policy.
“Apple’s recent capital return announcement seemed to halt a lengthy slide in its share price and is a microcosm of what is working in this slow nominal GDP and corporate revenue business cycle,” the strategist said in a report.

“We expect corporate management to favor repurchases over cash dividends, given flexibility and accretion. Repurchases are flexible because, unlike dividends, buybacks can be changed with little consequence, whereas management will go to great ends to avoid signalling a dividend cut.”
Pierre Lapointe, head of global strategy and research at Pavilion Global Markets, largely agrees with this assessment, adding de-equitization is a global phenomenon that should continue to support stock markets.
“Company managers are supporting earnings per share and equity returns by buying back their shares with excess cash or bond issuance,” he said in note this week. “Since 2009, de-equitization added no less than 17 percentage points to the performance of the Wilshire 5000.”
Mr. Nanji noted the pick-up in shareholder-friendly activities has also been evident in Canada over the past year. Notable recent events include Tim Hortons Inc. announcing its intention to explore a debt-financed repurchase program (and its willingness to sacrifice its credit rating as a result), Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and Canadian Tire Corp. spinning off real-estate assets, the activist-driven management shakeup at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and Agrium Inc.’s successful proxy battle against Jana Partners LLP.
The RBC credit analyst expects these types of activities will continue to benefit shareholders, but warns bondholders may be forced to accept greater risk in their portfolios, particularly when such activities involve companies that are issuing debt even though they have languishing stock prices, low levels of net debt and/or operational headwinds.
His watch list of names most susceptible to shareholder-friendly initiatives includes Tim Hortons and Metro Inc., which recently discussed a desire to grow via acquisitions as well as consider more meaningful share repurchases.
“Either scenario is likely to weigh on spreads, in our view,” he said.
Another Canadian company that may consider issuing debt in order to take shareholder-friendly steps is Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., whose lagging share price could result in accelerated share buybacks.
“While we think the company is more likely to issue debt to fund its capital growth plan, its active repurchase program (~$1.6B available at the current share price) leaves the door open to accelerate share buybacks if equity returns disappoint,” Mr. Nanji said.
Even though such initiatives increase risks for corporate bondholders, he said it’s important for investors to keep in mind the impact can widely vary.
“Some actions may have little immediate impact on bond spreads whereas others will be more immediately credit negative,” he said.
“On the whole, the results of such actions are to the detriment of bondholders and so keeping mindful of event risk is critical, particularly in the current environment.”

So I'm a high schooler, and I'm starting to think about what I want to major in once I start college. The thing is (and I apologize if this sounds dumb), I have NO idea what it means when people say that they're "going into business".
What does it mean to "go into business"? How do you do it? Is it a secure/smart choice? What should I do if I plan on going into business?

Hedge Fund Owner Gets Subpoena to Testify
By BEN PROTESS and PETER LATTMAN
Steve Marcus/ReutersSteven A. Cohen is expected to decline to testify.
Steven A. Cohen has received a subpoena to testify before a grand jury in the government’s insider trading investigation into his hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, a development that signals a newly aggressive phase in the multiyear inquiry, according to lawyers and executives briefed on the case.
Issued last week, the grand jury subpoena came as part of a broader round of requests from criminal authorities. Other SAC executives were also named in the subpoenas, the lawyers and executives said, and the fund itself received requests for information about its activities.
The subpoenas suggested that federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. are intensifying their efforts to build a case, not only against SAC executives, but also the fund itself. Typically, a grand jury will hear testimony and review evidence before deciding to approve an indictment.
Article Tools
But the fund, which has so far cooperated with the government’s inquiry, appeared to balk at some of these new requests. On Friday, SAC told its investors that it was no longer fully cooperating with the investigation.
“While we have in the past told you of our cooperation with the government’s investigation, our cooperation is no longer unconditional,” said a letter from SAC to its investors.
The curbing of the fund’s cooperation appeared to suggest that Mr. Cohen, rather than testify before the grand jury and be subject to questions from prosecutors on a broad range of topics, would assert his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the lawyers briefed on the case said.
Hedge Fund Inquiry
In the past, however, Mr. Cohen has given testimony in the government’s investigation. Last year, he sat for a civil deposition taken by federal securities regulators in an investigation of Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager who has been since criminally charged with illegally trading pharmaceutical stocks.
A spokesman for SAC, Jonathan Gasthalter, declined to comment.
A spokesman for the F.B.I. in New York, J. Peter Donald, and a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, Ellen Davis, both declined to comment about the case.
Neither the firm nor Mr. Cohen, a 56-year-old billionaire who owns it, has been charged with wrongdoing. Mr. Cohen has maintained that he has behaved appropriately at all times.
SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., manages roughly $15 billion and has one of the best investment track records on Wall Street, posting an average of 30 percent annual net returns to its investors over the last two decades.
Unlike most hedge funds, which are leanly staffed and typically have one person directing most of the investment decisions, SAC is a sprawling operation, with more than 1,000 employees — portfolio managers, analysts, traders and support staff — in five offices around the world. Despite SAC’s superior performance, the legal toll is mounting. Nine former or current SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the firm. Four of those employees have pleaded guilty, and two others, Mr. Martoma and Michael S. Steinberg, are fighting the criminal charges against them.
Even before the new subpoenas it was a delicate time for the hedge fund, which is trying to keep its investors from withdrawing their money. This new front in the case could give investors additional cause for concern.
SAC investors have already asked to withdraw $1.7 billion, more than a quarter of the $6 billion that the fund manages for outside clients. The balance of the fund’s $15 billion belongs to Mr. Cohen and his employees. To grant investors more time to decide whether to stick with the fund, SAC extended the next regularly scheduled deadline for SAC clients to ask for their money back from last week to early June.
SAC and its lawyers believed that it had put the most serious of its legal problems behind it earlier this year when agreeing to pay a record $616 million penalty to resolve two civil insider-trading lawsuits brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission . Those settlements involved the trading that led to charges against Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg.
But the government surprised Mr. Cohen and his firm by opening up this new chapter of the investigation.
Several weeks ago, federal prosecutors brought SAC’s lawyers in for a meeting at their offices in Lower Manhattan. More than a dozen government officials attended the session, led by Richard Zabel, the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan, according to a person briefed on the case. Prosecutors peppered SAC’s lawyers with questions about Mr. Cohen and the firm’s trading practices. Ultimately, the government decided to issue the grand jury subpoena.
By subpoenaing Mr. Cohen, the government indicated that it was pursuing a case against SAC itself. Federal guidelines discourage prosecutors from soliciting grand jury testimony from the target of an investigation, which suggests that Mr. Cohen was being treated as if he were a potential witness against his own fund.
While the authorities have not settled on a strategy, according to the lawyers and executives briefed on the case, they are pursuing an avenue that could possibly lead to an indictment against SAC, accusing it of allowing traders to carry out illicit activity over years.
But charges against companies are exceedingly rare. Enron ’s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, went out of businesses after it was indicted in 2002, taking 28,000 jobs with it. (The firm’s subsequent conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.) The episode served as a cautionary tale for prosecutors as they pursue indictments against companies, rather than executives.
Federal guidelines require them to weigh such action with “collateral consequences” like job losses and, in the case of big banks, a threat to the economy. An indictment against a hedge fund like SAC, however, would not destabilize the financial system the way that a prosecution of a large bank potentially could.
The government still faces challenges in its case. For one, the move could be interpreted as a last-ditch effort to ensnare Mr. Cohen. Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg have pleaded not guilty and refused to cooperate with the government in helping them build an insider-trading case against Mr. Cohen. And under the five-year statute of limitations for insider trading crimes, the authorities would have to file either criminal charges or a civil case against Mr. Cohen related to most of trades at issue in the Martoma and Steinberg cases by this summer.
By seeking Mr. Cohen’s testimony, federal prosecutors could be trying to get him lie before the grand jury, legal experts say. This way, they could try to charge him with perjury instead of insider trading, which was a similar tack that the government took in its criminal case against the media personality Martha Stewart.
As a result of the new requests, SAC decided that it could no longer provide its investors with updates on the inquiry.
“In the past we have tried to be as transparent with you as possible about the state of the investigation, while balancing our desire for transparency with the need to keep the details of a sensitive investigation confidential,” SAC said in the letter sent on Friday to investors.
“During this period, however,” the letter said, “the need for confidentiality will limit our ability to share with you details about how the investigation is progressing.”

How To Network Like A Pro

Learning how to network effectively is one of the most powerful tools an individual can use to advance their personal and professional life.
This skill can help you land your dream job, score a promotion, and become close with the leaders in your industry.
We spoke to networking guru Dr. Ivan Misner, Founder and Chairman of Business Network International , and Matthew Rothenberg, Editor-in-Chief of career content at TheLadders , about the secrets to networking effectively.
What does the best strategy for networking boil down to? Building real relationships, actively maintaining them, and giving as much as you take.
Of course, there's a lot more to it than just those details...
Why is networking important?
It's simple: knowing the right people can get you places that you might not reach otherwise.
Of all the areas where networking can help you, the most important are probably getting new business, finding a job, and having relationships with key people who can help you out in ways you can't predict yet.
Networking opens up new opportunities for you, TheLadders.com's Rothenberg says. Particularly in the case of job-hunting especially in this extremely competitive market, networking can be the difference between scoring a job and not.
Ultimately, it's all about the relationships: the ones you can build through networking are invaluable. As Misner puts it, "when times are tough, a client will leave you, but a friend won't."
How to get started: practice, practice, practice
If you've never done it before, networking can be an intimidating endeavor.
According to Rothenberg, the only way to become an expert networker is to "practice practice practice. The more you do it, the better you get."
To get started, Business Network International's Misner suggests first sitting down with a guidebook (we list several good ones at the end of this feature) and learning the basics.
You should also participate in a networking group; Misner breaks them down into 4 types:
Casual contact networks (networking events or industry mixers)
Knowledge networks (professional associations)
Strong contact networks (groups that meet frequently specifically to build professional relationships, like those run by BNI )
Online networks (professional social media services, such as LinkedIn)
If possible, you should be active in one of each.
1. Be visible
www.flickr.com
You won't be able to network if you're not visible. If people don't know who you are, you can't start building those important relationships.
Many small business owners are so focused on the day-to-day of their business that they forget about actively networking, Misner comments.
"Be visible. Networking is a contact sport! You have to get out and connect with people," he says.
2. Build solid relationships
"Trust is key to networking," says Misner.
You have to cultivate real, deep relationships with your contacts before you can ask them for a favor or expect them to send you business.
"It takes time for people to have confidence in you and have a relationship with you -- you have to invest in them," he continues.
One of Misner's favorite acronyms is "VCP," which stands for:
Visibility: "They know who you are and what you do."
Credibility: "They know who you are and what you do, and they know that you're good at it.
Profitability: "They trust you enough that they're willing to do business with you."
How do you develop these networking relationships? You approach your professional contacts as you would any other relationship, Misner says. "You have to sit down and learn about the individual."
Try connecting with them on a level other than business -- people bond over overlapping areas of interest, no matter what they are.
When you start to care about one another, you've developed a solid professional contact.
3. Diversify

Having a diverse network is just as important as having a large network. 
If you only know people who are like you -- i.e. in your industry or social group -- "your network becomes insular," says Misner.
But when your network is diverse, you're more likely to know "connectors," or those who can put you in touch with people you never would have met otherwise. And those people will be able to help you in different, better ways.
4. Maintain
In an interview with Inc. magazine, networking guru Keith Ferrazzi says, "Every free moment is a chance to E-mail or call someone." According to the profile, "He makes hundreds of phone calls a day....He sends E-mail constantly. He remembers birthdays and makes a special point of reaching people when they have one."
Your network will be useless if you don't maintain it -- that means constantly reaching out.
For beginners, Misner suggests making a game plan with a "scorecard" of networking points. Whenever you actively make an effort to reach out to a contact, you get a point.
Sending a thank-you note, making a phone call, arranging a meeting, sending an article of interest to someone, displaying someone else's goods in your store, putting someone else's link up on your Facebook... all of these count as networking, and you should be doing these as often as you can.
"Count those touchpoints! How many times are you reaching out?" Misner asks. "With the technology we have today, there is no excuse not to stay in touch."
5.Give back as much as you can

Giving is a crucial element of networking that people often forget.
According to the Inc. profile of Ferrazzi, "Successful networking is never about simply getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that people who are important to you get what they want, too."
Rothenberg recognizes that "it's easy to drop off when you're not actively in need of something." But you need to remember that networking is a perpetual give-and-take.
He continues, "You want to be the one people go to when they need something. That means suggesting somebody else for a job when you can, putting them in touch with an acquaintance they should know... You have to give, give, give."
Reaching out to a well-developed contact should come naturally
www.flickr.com
Building your network is just one part of networking; what happens when you need a favor?
Reaching out to a contact is often the aspect of networking that makes people most uncomfortable. But the exchange shouldn't be awkward.
If you've developed the relationship well, that favor will come naturally.
Rothenberg suggests asking what they need first, or doing a favor for them unprompted, before you ask for one.  
Also, he advises that "people hate to say 'no.' If you put them in a position where they can say 'yes,' they'll be happy to do so." This could mean that, instead of asking straight out for a job, you see if they'd be willing to write you a recommendation -- a much more likely request.
Most importantly, before reaching out to someone, Misner warns that you should always determine where you are in the relationship. "It would not be a good idea to e-mail your entire network [asking for a favor] -- that's called 'spamming.'" You have to behave appropriately and smartly depending on how close you are.
What if there's someone you don't know, but want to know? Rothenberg suggests that you "find that mutual connection. Even if it's a weak tie with someone, it works."
Or attend industry events, and don't feel bad about positioning yourself to meet that person you want to know.
And always remind yourself that you're focusing on building a relationship, not trying to get something out of them.
If you lose touch, don't hesitate to rekindle the relationship

If you've lost touch with a contact that you're wishing you could get in touch with now, you're not out of luck.
While you should never just call them out of the blue and ask for a favor -- "that would be very detrimental, in most cases!" Misner warns -- you shouldn't feel awkward about getting in touch.
"Send an email, or call them, and say you want to rekindle the relationship," says Misner.
The overall best way to handle it? Don't lose touch in the first place. Always be working at maintaining your network!
What if you're shy?

The thought of networking is most intimidating for people who are shy. Try to remember that you're really building relationships, not trying to get something out of someone.
Rothenberg suggests planning three interesting talking points to bring with you to a conversation with a contact. Make them things that you'll be excited to talk about and you know will interest them, too.
And, of course, practice will make you more comfortable, as well. "Make networking a natural part of your daily life," he adds.
You can find a good guide from CIO on more networking tips for shy individuals here .
Never, ever..
Misner's cardinal rule of networking: "Never, ever ask for anything from someone you've just met, who you don't have any relationship with."
"Networking goes bad when a complete stranger says 'let's do business together, hook me up, etc.... That's not networking, that's direct selling."
Above all, Misner repeats that networking isn't about passing out your business cards or asking people you don't know well for favors. "'Coin-operated networking' is bad for business. It doesn't work in the long-run."
Key takeaways
The key to successful networking is to remember that you're working on building real, deep relationships with your professional contacts.
Your network won't do you any good if it's full of lots of people who you don't know very well; cultivating both the depth and width of your network is extremely important.
"Networking is more about farming than it is about hunting," says Misner. "It's not just about who you know -- it's about how well you know them."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22591026|Yahoo to buy Tumblr for $1.1bn
Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales gives his reaction to Yahoo's deal with Tumblr
UK teen's app bought for 'millions'
Yahoo has agreed a deal to buy New York-based blogging service Tumblr for $1.1bn (£723m; 857m euros) in cash.
Yahoo's chief executive Marissa Mayer said that as part of its promise "not to screw it up", Tumblr would operate independently.
David Karp, will continue as chief executive officer of Tumblr.
The deal is the largest made by Ms Mayer since she took the helm at Yahoo last July, and she described the acquisition as a "unique opportunity."
"On many levels, Tumblr and Yahoo couldn't be more different, but at the same time, they couldn't be more complementary," added Ms Mayer.
Mr Karp, 26, who owns 25% of the privately-owned company he co-founded with Marco Arment in 2007, said he was "elated" to have the support of Yahoo.
"Tumblr gets better faster with more resources to draw from," he added. Mr Karp emphasised that neither its aims or team was changing as a result of Yahoo's purchase.
Analysis
Michelle Fleury BBC business correspondent, New York
Can Yahoo become hip again? In buying Tumblr, the company is trying to change its reputation with hipsters.
Yahoo was once a name synonymous with the internet, but its lead has been eclipsed by Google and it doesn't generate the same kind of buzz as Twitter or Facebook.
The odds of success may be stacked against it. Websites such as Mashable.com are already reporting a backlash among Tumblr's user base in reaction to reports of the Yahoo acquisition.
Simply buying a company like Tumblr doesn't guarantee street cred. Remember when News Corporation bought the social networking website MySpace? (MySpace was eventually sold for a fraction of the price News Corporation paid for it.)
Yahoo is hoping that its purchase of Tumblr will boost traffic to its other properties, such as the photo sharing site Flickr. But the $1.1bn question is: will it also help boost revenue?
Mobile devices
The $1.1bn price tag for Tumblr represents a significant premium on its $800m valuation when it last raised money from private investors.
Tumblr's 2012 revenue was just $13m, according to a report by Forbes magazine, leading analysts to suggest Yahoo had overpaid for the deal.
"Even if revenue was $100 million, it means Yahoo paid 10 times revenue," said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis. "Ten times is what you pay to date the belle of the ball. It's on the outer bands of M&A."
Tumblr combines elements of blogging with social networking, and its simple design has attracted millions of users since its launch.
According to its homepage, it now hosts 108 million blogs, with a total of 50.7 billion posts.
It also has a significant presence on mobile devices.
But despite its fast-growing user base, it has struggled to make money and has traditionally resisted advertising.
It said in April 2012 that it would roll out limited use of adverts.
Ms Mayer said Yahoo would now work with Tumblr to create ads that "are seamless and enhance the user experience".
Tumblr's founder David Karp will keep his role as chief executive
Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said that the quickest way for Yahoo to boost Tumblr's revenue would be to combine its sales force with the blogging site, but that this would risk alienating users.
"It's not clear that this deal will be favourable from a return-on-capital perspective," Wieser said. "One billion [dollars] for one company is a big bet."
Yahoo remains a giant in the internet world, with around 700 million visitors to its website every month. The majority of its revenues come from advertising.
But it has limited mobile reach and lags behind Google in the search engine rankings.
It also shed more than 1,000 jobs during 2012 and has long been divided over whether it should focus on media content or on tools and technologies.

Summary:
Fans of the social-blogging network might not like the idea much, but a $1-billion acquisition of Tumblr would arguably solve a number of problems for Yahoo — and do the same for Tumblr CEO David Karp.
According to a blizzard of anonymous news reports , Marissa Mayer is working feverishly to land the biggest fish of her career as CEO of Yahoo: namely, the $1-billion-plus acquisition of New York-based Tumblr, the ultra-hip blog network — the two are reportedly involved in discussions that could come to fruition as early as Sunday . Although Tumblr fans seem horrified by the idea, this one makes a substantial amount of sense for both sides.
Of course, as Om and others have already mentioned , there’s no guarantee this deal will actually be consummated: it could fall apart on valuation, as so many deals do — or Facebook could swoop in with a much higher offer and snatch Tumblr out of Yahoo’s clutches , the same way it did when it stole Instagram away from Twitter last year for close to $1 billion.
Update: According to the Wall Street Journal, the Yahoo board of directors has approved a $1.1-billion all-cash bid to acquire Tumblr.
It makes Yahoo look desperate — because it is
Even if the deal does get done, one of the risks for Mayer and Yahoo is that the company could look desperate by paying more than $1 billion for a site that had revenues of less than $15 million last year (although CEO David Karp has said that figure should hit $100 million this year). That’s an almost bubble-like multiple for a company, and there will likely be plenty of criticism from investors who believe that $1 billion could be better spent elsewhere — in other words, on businesses that would make Yahoo a better return.
But the painful fact is that Yahoo doesn’t just look desperate — in many ways it is desperate. Mayer has made some changes since she took over the ailing former web portal, including the acquisition of Summly and a number of other mobile-focused startups and services, but the company still needs to make some aggressive moves if it is going to jump-start any growth at all. And since Yahoo has about $4 billion in cash on hand, it can arguably afford to make a big bet.
Yahoo buying Tumblr makes sense. Tumblr is only big, cool, newish social platform that Yahoo can afford.—
Henry Blodget (@hblodget) May 17, 2013
For Yahoo, the addition of Tumblr would do a number of things: because of the size and profile of the deal, it would make a major statement about Mayer’s intention to do whatever it takes to revitalize the company, and it would also send a signal to Facebook and Google — and even Apple — that Yahoo is a potential force to be reckoned with when it comes to potential acquisitions. Is doing that worth $1 billion? That’s for Yahoo’s investors and board of directors to decide.
Just as important, it would inject some much-needed life and energy into the somewhat stale lineup of content that the company currently relies on, which caters more to the over-50 set than it does to anyone in the much-desired 18 to 25 demographic. More than any other network, Tumblr is the platform of choice for media-obsessed teens and 20-somethings , who spend massive amounts of time sharing photos and videos and animated GIFs on the site — an engine of potential value that Yahoo desperately needs.
Tumblr gets a massive exit
This doesn’t come without its own risks, of course: As a number of observers have noted, Tumblr’s content contains a large quantity of not only mature or arguably offensive content but outright pornography, which many argue is the source of its massive traffic numbers. How Yahoo (or Facebook for that matter) would deal with this kind of content remains to be seen.
3 q's for Yahoo: 1) Can you convert Tumblr users to Yahoo products? 2) Can you monetize Tumblr PVs? 3) What to do w/ all that Tumblr porn?—
Mark Zohar (@markzohar) May 18, 2013
For Tumblr, meanwhile, being acquired would solve a number of problems — the main one being that the company has gone well beyond the “we’re a startup so we don’t really have to make money” stage, and is facing increasing pressure from the investors who have given CEO David Karp more than $125 million in venture financing, an investment that values the company at about $800 million. Accepting a giant check from Yahoo would take care of that problem in one fell swoop, especially if it was all in cash.
With a major company like Yahoo as a partner, Tumblr could connect its massive audience of users to the firehose of ads and other monetization methods the giant web portal has, and potentially generate much more revenue than it could have by itself. The only lingering question at that point is whether Tumblr fans decide that Yahoo is poisoning the well of social content and community on the site, and decide to flee for greener pastures. In other words, does Yahoo make Tumblr into YouTube — a successful standalone network that can grow and prosper on its own — or does it become MySpace?
The only scenario where a Yahoo-Tumblr combo works is if Yahoo keeps Tumblr separate in the same way Google managed YouTube.—

Internet measurement techniques need a complete overhaul. New ways have emerged, potentially displacing older panel-based technologies. This will make it hard for incumbent players to stay in the game.
The web user is the most watched consumer ever. For tracking purposes, every large site drops literally dozens of cookies in the visitor’s browser. In the most comprehensive investigation on the matter, The Wall Street Journal found that each of the 50 largest web sites in the United Sates, weighing 40% of the US page views, installed an average of 64 files on a user device. (See the WSJ’s What They Know series and a Monday Note about tracking issues .) As for server logs, they record every page sent to the user and they tell with great accuracy which parts of a page collect most of the reader’s attention.
But when it comes to measuring a digital viewer’s commercial value, sites rely on old-fashioned panels, that is limited user population samples. Why?
Panels are inherited. They go back to the old days of broadcast radio when, in order to better sell advertising, dominant networks wanted to know which station listeners tuned in to during the day. In the late thirties, Nielsen Company made a clever decision: they installed a monitoring box in 1000 American homes. Twenty years later, Nielsen did the same, on a much larger scale, with broadcast television. The advertising world was happy to be fed with plenty of data — mostly unchallenged as Nielsen dominated the field. (For a detailed history, you can read Rating the Audience , written by two Australian media academics). As Nielsen expanded to other media (music, film, books and all sorts of polls), moving to the internet measurement sounded like a logical step. As of today, Nielsen only faces smaller competitors such as ComScore and others.
I have yet to meet a publisher who is happy with this situation. Fearing retribution, very few people talk openly about it (twisting the dials is so easy, you know…), but hey all complain about inaccurate, unreliable data. In addition, the panel system is vulnerable to cheating on a massive scale. Smarty pants outfits sell a vast array of measurement boosters, from fake users that will come in just once a month to be counted as “unique” (they are indeed), to more sophisticated tactics such as undetectable “pop under” sites that will rely on encrypted URLs to deceive the vigilance of panel operators. In France for instance, 20% to 30% of some audiences can be bogus — or largely inflated. To its credit, Mediametrie — the French Nielsen affiliate that produces the most watched measurements — is expending vast resources to counter the cheating, and to make the whole model more reliable. It works, but progress is slow. In August 2012, Mediametrie Net Ratings (MNR), launched a Hybrid Measure taking into account site centric analytics (server logs) to rectify panel numbers, but those corrections are still erratic. And it takes more than a month to get the data, which is not acceptable for the real-time-obsessed internet.
Publishers monitor the pulse of their digital properties on a permanent basis. In most newsrooms, Chartbeat (also imperfect, sometimes) displays the performance of every piece of content, and home pages get adjusted accordingly. More broadly, site-centric measures detail all possible metrics: page views, time spent, hourly peaks, engagement levels. This is based on server logs tracking dedicated tags inserted in each served page. But the site-centric measure is also flawed: If you use, say, four different devices — a smartphone, a PC at home, another at work, and a tablet — you will be incorrectly counted as four different users. And if you use several browsers you could be counted even more times. This inherent site-centric flaw is the best argument for panel vendors.
But, in the era of Big Data and user profiling, panels no longer have the upper hand.
The developing field of statistical pairing technology shows great promise. It is now possible to pinpoint a single user browsing the web with different devices in a very reliable manner. Say you use the four devices mentioned earlier: a tablet in the morning and the evening; a smartphone for occasional updates on the move, and two PCs (a desktop at the office and a laptop elsewhere). Now, each time you visit a new site, an audience analytics company drops a cookie that will record every move on every site, from each of your devices. Chances are your browsing patterns will be stable (basically your favorite media diet, plus or minus some services that are better fitted for a mobile device.) Not only your browsing profile is determined from your navigation on a given site, but it is also quite easy to know which sites you have been to before the one that is currently monitored, adding further precision to the measurement.
Over time, your digital fingerprint will become more and more precise. Until then, the set of four cookies is independent from each other. But the analytics firm compiles all the patterns in single place. By data-mining them, analysts will determine the probability that a cookie dropped in a mobile application, a desktop browser or a mobile web site belongs to the same individual. That’s how multiple pairing works. (To get more details on the technical and mathematical side of it, you can read this paper by the founder of Drawbridge Inc.) I recently discussed these techniques with several engineers both in France and in the United Sates. All were quite confident that such fingerprinting is doable and that it could be the best way to accurately measure internet usage across different platforms.
Obviously, Google is best positioned to perform this task on a large scale. First, its Google Analytics tool is deployed over 100 millions web sites. And the Google Ad Planner, even in its public version, already offers a precise view of the performance of many sites in the world. In addition, as one of the engineers pointed out, Google is already performing such pairing simply to avoid showing the same ad twice to a someone using several devices. Google is also most likely doing such ranking in order to feed the obscure “quality index” algorithmically assigned to each site. It even does such pairing on a nominative basis by using its half billion Gmail accounts (425 million in June 2012) and connecting its Chrome users. As for giving up another piece of internet knowledge to Google, it doesn’t sounds like a big deal to me. The search giant knows already much more about sites than most publishers do about their own properties. The only thing that could prevent Google from entering the market of public web rankings would be the prospect of another privacy outcry. But I don’t see why it won’t jump on it — eventually. When this happens, Nielsen will be in big trouble.

Yahoo just laid down a $1.1 billion cash bet it can make Tumblr, the indie blogging-and-arguing platform, a profitable part of its advertising business. Here are some back-of-the-envelope calculations of what has to happen for that bet to pay off.
Sell out 60 percent of the current “Radar” section: Tumblr says it delivers more than 120 million impressions per day through its “Radar,” a showcase of interesting Tumblr posts that appears to the right of the Tumblr “Dashboard,” the content stream consumed by users that contains posts from Tumblr blogs they follow. Sponsors can buy their way into Radar at a rate of $4.16 per thousand impression, according to one published report . If Tumblr were able and willing to sell out its entire inventory of Radar impressions, it would have a nice annual revenue stream worth upwards of $182.5 million.
Now, Yahoo needs to make around $108 million per year off Tumblr to cover its opportunity cost, former Google and NBC exec John Saroff figures (in an analysis I heartily recommend). So it “only” needs to sell around 60 percent of Radar capacity.
Trouble is, selling all or even a majority of Radar’s inventory isn’t really possible as Radar is now configured, with one content slot to the right of the main content stream. The whole reason Tumblr can demand a $4+ CPM for ads in this slot is that users have been trained to look there for organic, unpaid content, and it’s a standalone showcase for a single piece of content. To sell around 60 percent of current capacity, Tumblr would need to add slots so it would show two or three pieces of content at a time. This would probably reduce clickthrough rates and bring down the CPM – hopefully not too much to erase the doubling or tripling of inventory.
Selling Radar slots is also complicated by the fact that only Tumblr posts can go in those slots, so Tumblr can only sell these sponsored positions to brands that have (or are willing to create) their own Tumblr, and who are willing to use Tumblr posts as their ads.
Convince top Tumblr bloggers to run ads: Tumblr could enable individual users to “flip a switch” and run advertising, either in the form of cheap network/remnant ads or premium sponsored posts. With around 79 billion U.S. pageviews annually, Tumblr would need to sell all domestic inventory at a CPM of around $1.37 to get to $108 million per year entirely off U.S. network ads.
This sort of CPM is entirely plausible, Saroff says. But of course Tumblr can’t sell its full U.S. inventory. Many Tumblr owners would balk at running ads, especially of the cheap-looking remnant sort; Tumblr CEO David Karp himself famously said advertising “turns our stomachs” in 2010 before recanting. And other Tumblr owners will never be eligible for ads because they run porn or other such content , which Yahoo has already said will be excluded from its advertising programs.
To make up the difference, Tumblr will need to grow traffic, take advertising international or move upmarket. Indeed, if the blog network can build bridges between premium advertisers and its more elite contributors, it could become a home for crafted ads, like sponsored posts, that are more palatable to finicky members.
Sell 31 million ads annually to small businesses and egotists: There are the big brand advertisers mentioned above and then there are the small-time, self service advertising customers, often small business owners or individuals. Tumblr has options for the latter group, too: For $2, they can ensure a post gets a highlight sticker so it stands out in followers’ Tumblr Dashboards, and for $5 they can a post to the top of followers’ dashboards. To get to $108 million exclusively on these small-time ad options, Tumblr would need to sell around 31 million promoted posts a year, assuming buyers divide evenly between pinned posts and the cheaper highlighted posts.
Before you scoff at that notion, consider that promoting small business posts to existing followers has been the focus of a major revenue push for Facebook as the social media giant tries to grow its more than $5 billion in annual revenue.
Some combination of the above: Of course, Yahoo and its new toy Tumblr probably aren’t banking on any one of the above revenue opportunities so much as a combination – plus new revenue lines (like video ads) not yet on the table. Some creativity will be required to make the Tumblr acquisition pay off – but not as much as you might think at first blush.
Between Tumblr’s massive user base and Yahoo’s many available ad options, Yahoo should be able to make its acquisition pencil. The trick is not alienating too many Tumblr-ers in the process.

By Nilay Patel 9 hours ago
"For the first time, you and your TV will have a relationship."
That's how Microsoft began the introduction of its new Xbox One today — a presentation that focused less on games and more on the new console as a complete living room device. "The ultimate all-in-one entertainment system," said Microsoft's Don Mattrick. And since no ultimate entertainment system is complete without television, the event segued neatly into a demonstration of the new Xbox's Live TV feature . Just say the name of a channel and it'll switch; say the name of a show and the Xbox will find it. Jumping from TV to game to the built-in Internet Explorer browser is instant, we were told. Watching an NBA basketball game? Say "fantasy" and you'll see stats and highlights instantly appear.
The message was clear: the Xbox One features seamlessly integrated television. People on Twitter began asking me about built in tuners, how big the DVR was, and whether it would support antennas as well as cable. For one glorious moment, it looked like Microsoft had achieved the dream.
The Xbox One's TV integration is a familiar nightmare
The problem is that the demoes weren't real — the Xbox One's TV integration is the same familiar nightmare we've known for nearly 20 years now. Instead of actually integrating with your TV service, the One sits on top of it: you plug your cable box's HDMI cable into the Xbox, which overlays the signal with its own interface. If you're lucky enough to own a newer cable box, you'll get to change channels directly through the HDMI connection, but most people will find themselves using the One's included IR blaster to control their cable or satellite boxes — a failure-prone one-way communication system that stubbornly refuses to die.
Exactly the same way Google TV works
If this sounds familiar to you, it's because it's exactly the same way Google's flailing Google TV platform works. (Google TV even had an NBA demo when it launched in 2011.) If you're a little older it should be even more familiar: it's exactly how Microsoft's own doomed webTV platform worked. We've been overlaying fancy interfaces on top of cable signals and praying for IR blasters to adequately control the boxes for years now, and it's never worked — the content and information on your cable box is too valuable to relegate it to second place, and jumping back and forth between interfaces is irritating and stupid.
What's more, these systems only really work for live television, which you probably aren't watching. Want to watch a show recorded on your DVR? There's no way for the Xbox One to know about it, so you have to use the DVR interface. Found a great show using the One's search and discovery tools and want to record the season? Time to switch to the DVR interface again. IR blaster miss a channel change? The One's guide and channel bar will show different information than the cable box. The cable box is the canonical interface for television, and every attempt to usurp or overlay it has failed.
Xbox One won't free you from your cable box — it'll stay firmly chained to it
Microsoft seems to know that it has a challenge ahead of it and that the Xbox One's TV functionality needs to evolve quickly — the official press release for the Xbox One promises that the company is "committed to bringing Live TV through various solutions to all the markets where Xbox One will be available," and the company's FAQ simply states that "the delivery of TV is complex." And indeed, in European markets where the Xbox 360 is already able to serve as an IPTV cable box, there's a chance the One could achieve the sort of seamless integration we all hoped for as Microsoft began its demo today.
But Microsoft is launching the Xbox One in the United States, where the hyper-fragmented television market will keep that IR Out port firmly in play until broadband TV services like Aereo take off or the cable companies themselves build streaming services. And that's years away. Until then, the Xbox One won't free you from your cable box — it'll stay firmly chained to it.

"[Drones are a] game-changing technology, akin to gunpowder, the steam engine, the atomic bomb -- opening up possibilities that were fiction a generation earlier but also opening up perils that were unknown a generation ago." -- Peter Singer , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution
America will never be a "no drone zone."
That must be acknowledged from the outset. There is too much money to be made on drones, for one, and too many special interest groups -- from the defense sector to law enforcement to the so-called "research" groups that are in it for purely "academic" reasons -- who have a vested interest in ensuring that drones are here to stay.
At one time, there was a small glimmer of hope that these aerial threats to privacy would not come home to roost, but that all ended when Barack Obama took office and made drones the cornerstone of his war efforts. By the time President Obama signed the FAA Reauthorization Act into law in 2012, there was no turning back. The FAA opened the door for drones, once confined to the battlefields over Iraq and Afghanistan, to be used domestically for a wide range of functions, both public and private, governmental and corporate. It is expected that at least 30,000 drones will occupy U.S. airspace by 2020 , ushering in a $30 billion per year industry.
Those looking to the skies in search of Predator drones will be in for a surprise, however, because when the drones finally descend en masse on America, they will not be the massive aerial assault vehicles favored by the Obama administration in their overseas war efforts. Rather, the drones coming to a neighborhood near you will be small, some nano in size, capable of flying through city streets and buildings almost undetected, while hovering over cityscapes and public events for long periods of time, providing a means of 24/7 surveillance.
One type of drone sensor, the Gorgon Stare, can keep track of an area 2.5 miles across from 12 different angles. Another sensor system, ARGUS , can find an object that is only 6 inches long, from 20,000 feet up in the air. A drone equipped with this kind of technology could spy on an entire city at once. For example, police in California are about to begin using Qube drones , which are capable of hovering for 40 minutes at heights of about 400 ft. to conduct surveillance on targets as far as one kilometer away. Michael Downing, the LAPD deputy chief for counter-terrorism and special operations, envisions drones being flown over large-scale media events such as the Oscars, using them to surveil political protests, and flying them through buildings to track criminal suspects.
These micro-drones will be the face of surveillance and crowd control in the coming drone age.
Modeled after birds, insects, and other small animals, these small airborne surveillance devices can remain hidden in plain view while navigating spaces off limits to conventional aircraft. Able to take off and land anywhere, able to maneuver through city streets and hallways, and able to stop and turn on a dime, these micro-drones will still pack a lethal punch, equipped with an array of weapons and sensors, including tasers , bean-bag guns, " high-resolution video cameras , infrared sensors, license plate readers, [and] listening devices."
You can rest assured, given the pace of technology and the fervor of the drone industry (and its investors), that the sky is the limit when it comes to the many uses (and abuses) for drones in America. The following is just a small sampling of what will be descending from the skies in the near future.
Cyborg drones. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has begun to develop a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) for the manipulation of insects into "cyborgs." Through genetic engineering , they are aiming to control the movement of insects and utilize them for surveillance purposes.
Dragonfly drone. First reportedly spotted in 2007 hovering over protesters at an anti-war rally in Washington, DC, it turns out that the government's dragonfly drones are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to small aerial surveillance devices designed to mimic nature. Just a year later, the U.S. Air Force "unveiled insect-sized spies 'as tiny as bumblebees' that could not be detected and would be able to fly into buildings to 'photograph, record, and even attack insurgents and terrorists.'"
Hummingbird drone. Shaped like a bird, the "Nano Hummingbird" drone is negligibly larger than an actual hummingbird and fits in the palm of one's hand. It flits around effortlessly , blending in with its surroundings. DARPA, the advanced research division of the Department of Defense, gets the credit for this biotic wonder.
Nano Quadrators. Similar to the hummingbird drone, these small, four-propellered nano quadrator drones, developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, operate based upon the flight dynamics of insects, enabling them to operate as a swarm . Using 20 drones, researchers demonstrated how, moving compactly as a unit, the drones were able to navigate obstacles, form complex patterns, and even execute a fluid figure eight arrangement .
Black Hornet Nano drone. Weighing in at roughly half an ounce and four inches long, comparable to a finch, the Black Hornet Nano helicopter drone was designed to capture and relay video and still images to remote users, and can fly even in windy conditions.
DASH Roachbot drone. Developed at UC Berkeley's PolyPEDAL Lab, DASH, a 10-centimeter long, 16-gram Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod strives to mimic a cockroach's speed and ability to remain covert and a gecko's speed and agility. Trained to perform "rapid inversion" maneuvers that include dashing up to a ledge and then swinging itself around to end up underneath the ledge and upside-down, DASH is being trained to make rapid transitions between running and climbing .
Samarai drone. Lockheed Martin's compact "Samarai" drone, inspired by the design of a maple seed , is capable of high speeds, low battery consumption, vertical movement, and swift ground deployment.
MicroBat drone. Additionally, CIT Group, Aerovironment, and UCLA have produced a " MicroBat " ornithopter; it was designed in part by zoologists who have attempted to make the MicroBat mimic the movement of birds and other flying animals.
Spy-butterfly drone. In 2012, Israel unveiled its new insect-inspired drone which they dubbed the "spy-butterfly" because of its two sizable wings. Weighing in at only 20g, this drone was developed for indoor surveillance, including public places such as "train stations and airport terminals -- or office buildings." The size and muted sound of the "virtually noiseless" machines makes them unnoticeable and therefore ideal for intelligence gathering. The spy-butterfly is so realistic that, when tested, "birds and flies tended to fall behind the device arranging into a flock."
Switchblade drone. A more sinister example is the Switchblade, a small military drone intended to act as a kamikaze weapon . Weighing in at a mere six pounds and two feet in length, it flies effortlessly through urban environments before zeroing in on its target, a person, at which point it explodes , unceremoniously killing him or her.
Mosquito drone. More lethal than its real-life counterpart, the mosquito drone , while an engineering marvel, is also a privacy advocate's nightmare with its potential to land on someone and use a needle-like-pincer to extract DNA from its victims or, alternatively, inject drugs or other foreign substances. As software engineer Alan Lovejoy notes :
Such a device could be controlled from a great distance and is equipped with a camera, microphone. It could land on you and then use its needle to take a DNA sample with the pain of a mosquito bite. Or it could inject a micro RFID tracking device under your skin. It could land on you and stay, so that you take it with you into your home. Or it could fly into a building through a window. There are well-funded research projects working on such devices with such capabilities.
Raven drone. Weighing in at 4 pounds, the RQ-11 Raven drone is not as small, nor is it as agile as its smaller counterparts, but with more than 19,000 out there already , it is the most common. Useful for seeing around corners and sending footage back to its handlers, the Raven resembles a rudimentary model airplane and crumbles like Legos upon landing.
With 63 active drone sites across the nation and 56 government agencies presently authorized to use drones, including 22 law enforcement agencies and 24 universities, drones are here to stay. Indeed, the cost of drones -- underwritten by a $4 million Homeland Security program which encourages local law enforcement to adopt drone technology as quickly as possible -- makes them an easy sell for most police departments. Moreover, while manned airplanes and helicopters can cost $600/hour to operate, a drone can be put in the sky for less than $25/hour . That doesn't even begin to cover drone use by the private sector, which is already chomping at the bit at the prospect.
No matter what the future holds, however, we must ensure that Americans have a semblance of civil liberties protections against the drones. Given the courts' leniency towards police, predicating drone use on a warrant requirement would provide little to no protection.  Thus, the only hope rests with Congress and state legislatures that they would adopt legislation specifically prohibiting the federal government from using data recorded via police spy drones in criminal prosecutions, as well as preventing police agencies from utilizing drones outfitted with anti-personnel devices such as tasers and tear gas.
Either way, we'd better get ready. As Peter W. Singer, author of Wired for War, a book about military robotics, warns : "The debate over drones is like debating the merits of computers in 1979: They are here to stay, and the boom has barely begun. We are at the Wright Brothers Flier stage of this. There's no stopping this technology. Anybody who thinks they can put this genie back in the box -- that's silliness."
 

http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/20/4339446/google-glass-apps-everything-you-can-do-right-now|Google Glass apps: everything you can do right now
By Paul Miller 05.20.2013
Google Glass isn’t ready for prime time. Even Google knows this, which is why it hasn't shipped to the masses yet. Instead, Google floated a few units to “ Explorers ,” glorified guinea pigs who can enjoy the joys and trials of this cuttingest edge of cutting edge technologies. But nascent or not, Glass exists, and it works . Or at least it "works." Developers are still getting their feet wet, high-profile apps like Twitter and Facebook feel more like experiments than finished products, and bugs aren’t the exception, they’re the rule. But, you know, the thing turns on, and hears you say "Okay, Glass," and eagerly awaits your next command. Beyond the home screen, it’s up to Glass Explorers to wade through the good apps, the bad apps, and the broken apps, and we're right there with them. We went exploring, and this is what Glass can do; right here, right now.
And for those of you without Glass, hopefully we can help you live vicariously through our misadventures and humble GIF illustrations. Glass is a strange beast, and it can take a while to get used to and understand what it’s trying to do. Maybe we’ll make you jealous, or maybe you’ll decide Glass is a worthless piece of trash. Either way, we hope we can shed light on the mystery, the wonder, and the social awkwardness that is Glass.
We’ll be updating this list as new apps come out, and old apps are updated or made obsolete, so keep checking back. And if you see an app we haven’t covered yet, make sure to let us know!
Sticky TOC engaged! Do not remove this!
Glass basics
Glass basics
Glass’ basic paradigm is one of a "timeline" full of "cards." Each card, when tapped, can reveal more cards, or present actions like "reply" or "delete." Some cards can be "pinned," which places them to the left of the home screen. Otherwise, cards are sorted chronologically to the right of the home screen.
While Glass’ best known interaction method is the verbal "Okay, Glass" prompt, most of the UI can only be operated by swipes and taps. Outside of the homescreen, the only time you’ll be speaking is when you’re composing a text reply to a card in your timeline (like an email message, or a tweet). While voice might seem like a gimmick, it’s actually preferable to the hypersensitive touchpad at times — we’ve accidentally tapped to share a photo with the wrong Google+ contact a dozen times, simply because Glass registers a tap instead of a swipe. At least when you’re talking you get a chance to cancel the action if you’re misheard.
Glass’ very simplicity means there’s actually a steep learning curve: You have to use Glass how Google wants you to use Glass, or it just doesn’t work. Also, you have to be really good at swiping and tapping.
Setup
When you first boot up Glass, after a long stare at the Glass logo, you’re presented with a URL to visit on your phone or computer to set up the device: google.com/myglass . From there you log in to your Google account (@gmail.com addresses only, for now), and begin a breezy setup to pair your device to that account. The big moment is when you enter a Wi-Fi network, which generates a QR code. Glass’ camera will recognize the QR code automatically and then join that network. Congratulations, you’ve set up Glass!
From now on, the MyGlass site will be your home base for Glass configuration — the device itself offers little in the way of preferences, it’s more of a viewer for the content and interactions you enable from MyGlass. It's also easy to overload your Glass with contacts and apps, and since deleting cards from your timeline is a pain, you want to make sure all your incoming content is quality.
We recommend you do the setup from a computer, because the next step is a pain: adding contacts. You have to enter a name manually, and then Glass pulls a contact card from your Gmail account. If your Gmail contacts are a mess (ours sure are), you’ll probably have to tweak each Gmail contact by hand to make sure the correct email address is at the top. And that it’s the right version of that contact — it’s all a little mysterious, but you’ll know you’ve got the right one if a profile pic shows up in MyGlass. Even then, Glass won’t play nice with everybody: for instance, the voice recognition won’t register "Jordan Oplinger" no matter how hard we try.
Confusingly, there is a second set of contacts, called Sharing Contacts, that’s simply comprised of your Google+ friends and Circles. Those require less management, but some Glass apps work only through adding themselves to your Sharing Contacts, so you’ll have to watch out for that and be sure to switch off any apps or friends you don’t want to accidentally share to.
Next you’ll want to install some apps. MyGlass offers a few apps by default, like Twitter, Facebook, New York Times, CNN, Google Now, and Path. You simply click the "on" button and the app will come alive. If you want other apps, there’s no app store to go to — you’ll have to hunt them down and install them yourself. Or you could refer to this handy little list.
We recommend you do the setup from a computer
MyGlass Android app
Google’s Android app for Glass doesn’t offer anything beyond the web app in terms of device management, but it does include two very important features: tethering and mirroring. Because Glass doesn’t have a cell radio, tethering to your phone is necessary for internet service on the go, and the MyGlass app makes it very simple. MyGlass finds nearby Glass devices and attempts to pair with them. A tap on your Glass to accept finishes the job. Unfortunately, while the setup is easy, keeping a connection isn’t, and we hope the Bluetooth reliability is a software problem that future updates can solve. Until then, a Wi-Fi hotspot might be your preferred solution, if your phone can handle the battery drain.
Mirroring is just a way to show what’s happening on your Glass screen on your Android screen — a "wow your friends feature" that’s much appreciated.
While the setup is easy, keeping a connection isn’t
Built-in apps
Built-in apps
Glass is not an all-purpose computer, it's a Google computer. All of its core experiences are based on Google+, Google Search, and Gmail, and there's no way to change that. The more of a Google ecosystem adherent you are, the more utility you'll get out of Glass. If you're okay with that, Glass can be a really slick, natural experience. If you're not okay with that, you should probably be in the market for a different wearable computer.
"ok glass" launcher
The main screen of Google Glass shows a simple clock, and below it the words "ok glass." If you say "Okay, Glass," you’re sent into a launcher that lists Glass’ primary functions. There’s no need to pause after saying "Okay, Glass" before the next command. For instance, you could say "Okay, Glass, send a message to Joshua Topolsky" in one breath and Glass will keep up with you (if Joshua Topolsky is one of your contacts). Unfortunately, it’s easy to misspeak and watch Glass eagerly perform the wrong command — like sending a message to the wrong Joshua. Worse, Glass can hear other people talking in the vicinity, and is likely to pepper some of their words in as well. Depending on your friend set, tapping through the menus might be safer. At least Glass filters out expletives and "unsafe" searches, but a clever troll can still find ways to prompt a disgusting Google Image search if you're not careful — we only barely dodged a "horse diarrhea" query at the office the other day.
Glass can hear other people talking in the vicinity
Google Search
The first option in the launcher, Google Search, prompts you to "ask a question," but Glass doesn’t flinch if you just speak a regular search term. The results are wild cards, because for certain queries Glass delivers six beautiful, Glass-appropriate results, and others are simply a list of six unclickable links with short, usually useless descriptions. Glass Search works best when you do actually ask a question, like "How tall is Ryan Gosling?" instead of just "Ryan Gosling." When Glass knows the actual answer, it speaks the result out loud. (Ryan Gosling is 6’1", by the way). If you search for "images of Ryan Gosling" you get six photos of the man, and if you ask when the Knicks game is on Glass will tell you, but it doesn’t know how fast a cheetah or a giraffe runs.
Glass Search works best when you ask questions
"take a picture"
If you say "Take a picture," Glass will take a picture. It happens instantly, without any preview of what you’re about to get — the idea is to frame with your eyeballs, so hopefully you have Glass on straight. The photo is then flashed up in front of you, stashed in a new card, and synced privately to Google+. When you swipe over to the card and tap it, you get the option to share the photo with your Sharing Contacts (comprised of Google+ friends, Google+ Circles, and apps), or to delete it. Additionally, the photo is stashed in Glass’ physical storage, and can be manually transferred to your computer over USB.
The idea is to frame with your eyeballs
"record a video"
When you start recording, Glass will automatically start recording for 10 seconds, and with a tap you can cut the video short or extend recording indefinitely. After it’s captured, the video is stored on Google+ and shareable in the same way photos are — though not every service will accept shared video, and it's not always clear which ones will.
With a tap you can extend the recording indefinitely
"get directions to…"
If your search results include an item with an address, you can tap on it to get directions. Alternatively, you can request directions to an address or point of interest by speaking, "Get directions to" and your destination. The first time you do this, Glass will sternly warn you, "Do not manipulate this application while in motion," which you will tap to ignore and then be taken through turn-by-turn directions. The compass responds to your head motions, so you know exactly if you’re pointed the right way. You can tap again to see the entire route, or swipe over to choose between walking, driving, and biking directions — there are no public transportation directions available as of yet. If you exit out of the map, the destination will be pinned to the left of the "ok glass" screen so you can resume your trip at any time.
"Do not manipulate this application while in motion."
"send a message to…"
Saying "Send a message to" presents you with your list of hand-picked contacts. Then you simply speak your message and Google will transcribe it. When you stop talking you have a brief moment to swipe and cancel, and then the message is sent automatically — typos and all. It’s sent as a regular email from your Gmail account, with a "Sent through Glass" signature, and a card will show up in your timeline. Replies show up inside that card, just like with all Gmail conversations on Glass, and you can continue the conversation at any point by tapping "reply."
Speaking of Gmail, Glass shows some messages from your Gmail inbox, but not all of them. It seems queued off of emails that Gmail flags for your priority inbox, but that can be a little mysterious — like with all things, Glass won't become your primary Gmail interface, only a small supplement. The account we used Glass with wasn’t a high-volume account, but we’re curious how others will handle the influx of emails into their timelines.
The message is sent automatically — typos and all
"make a call to…"
If you’ve paired your phone with Glass, you can make a phone call to one of your contacts. It works fine, but you’ll have to decide for yourself if Glass’ bone conduction speaker and microphone are sufficiently loud for your conversation — much more than a quiet conversation nearby can easily drown you out.
Much more than a quiet conversation can easily drown you out
"hang out with…"
Hangouts couldn’t be easier on Glass. From the home screen you speak "Hang out with…" followed by the name of your chosen friend or circle, and they’ll be invited automatically. Conveniently, Google just unified Hangouts across its services, so your friend is more likely to notice your call — in our experience, an unsolicited hangout is typically an unfulfilled hangout. Also in our experience: Hangouts are horribly buggy and unreliable, so be sure to pick a very patient friend that doesn't mind attempting a dozen calls before one connects.
Once connected, you’re treated to a view of one of your Hangout participants at a time, based on whoever is speaking, while they see what your camera sees. With a tap you can enable the names of the participants, in case you’re chatting with strangers or your friends are wearing masks. Like with phone calls, it can be a little hard to hear Hangouts participants, especially when you’re talking to multiple people at once, but the novelty factor is high enough to tolerate the impracticality of it all.
The novelty factor is high enough to tolerate the impracticality
Google Now
Our Google Now card seems mostly concerned with the local restaurants available at any moment, but every Now experience is different, based on your location, activities, and whatever web activity of yours Google is tracking and Now-ifying these days — there are at least 25 "cards" that have been developed so far. Glass also has a very beautiful, simple weather widget that’s always available to the left of the home screen. It's Glass' reliance on serendipity that's both its greatest strength and greatest weakness, and Now is the case in point.
Every Google Now experience is different
Third-party apps
Third-party apps
All third-party Google Glass apps ("Glassware," as Google calls them) are developed with what’s called the " Mirror API ," which basically means all apps are presented in the form of cards in your timeline, not as core functionalities available from the main "ok glass" menu. No developer would be able to build an equivalent of Glass’ Map app, but they will be able to build a lot of New York Times app clones. Google wants developers to push HTML info to you, receive photos, videos, and text from you, and be happy about it. If history is any indication, developers won't be happy about it — just look at how long the iPhone lasted with web apps before Apple broke down and built a real SDK. Still, for now Glass is a content consumption and content sharing device, and it might stay that way for a while.
Of course, Google Glass can also be hacked to sideload Android apps (APKs), which can circumvent these limitations. We’ll mostly focus on legit apps, but some hacks are too good to pass up.
New York Times
Before Twitter and Facebook showed up, New York Times was the flagship third-party launch app for Glass — which was a little sad. Not that there’s anything wrong with the app: once activated from your MyGlass page, the Times will give you a new card once an hour with a roundup of new stories (there aren’t any preferences, so you can’t lower that frequency), along with an occasional lone breaking story. Inside the card you can scroll through the stories, and tap to have Glass read you a summary out loud, but that’s all there is. A share button wouldn’t go amiss, nor would an option to filter out subjects you just don't care about when you're wearing Glass — like politics, for instance.
A share button wouldn't go amiss
Twitter
Twitter’s app adds a Sharing Contact, which lets you share photos from Glass to your adoring public. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t let you do standalone text tweets, and you can’t add a description before you upload. You can, however, compose text tweets when you engage with @ replies from people who you follow. But you can’t @ reply yourself, so nothing you say will be visible to all your followers — just your photos. Any tweet can be favorited or retweeted as well.
It doesn’t let you do standalone text tweets
Facebook
Facebook’s Glass implementation is even more minimal than Twitter’s. Once activated, the app simply installs three new Sharing Contacts for distributing photo to the appropriate audience: Public, Friends, and Only Me — good luck never tapping the wrong one. Video uploads aren’t available, and while you can add a description to a photo after it’s uploaded (the posted photo boomerangs back to your timeline), you can’t see or respond to comments or likes. Also, Steven's name is Stephen, and we're not sure how to convince Glass of that fact.
Even more minimal than Twitter
Evernote
Evernote lets you share photos with your Evernote account, which show up in your inbox as a "Note from Glass." While that’s the extent of the sharing functionality — you can’t tag or comment on photos after they’re uploaded, though Evernote can run text recognition to transcribe your handwriting — it’s kind of a relief to have a service on Glass that’s not dedicated to publicizing your life. Perhaps more interestingly, from Evernote you can push a note to your Glass timeline — like a shopping list, for instance — which could help sync up your Glass life with your real life.
A relief to have a service not dedicated to publicizing your life
Tumblr
Like everyone else, Tumblr adds a Sharing Contact to beam photos to. Unlike everyone else, Tumblr actually offers a preferences pane on its site to customize your experience: you can pick which of your Tumblrs you’d like to share with (the name of that Tumblr is what the contact will be), and set the frequency of Dashboard updates. Unfortunately, if you follow a lot of Tumblrs, your timeline will be inundated with posts, even if you select the "some" option instead of the "all" option. At least GIFs work, which beats Google's own apps — even stills don't show up in Gmail.
Tumblr actually offers a preferences pane
Elle
When the Elle app installs you get a preference pane to pick what news you want to receive from the fashion magazine. You can also input your sign to receive your daily horoscope. Elle’s updates come in various forms, from the basic single news item (which can be read aloud), to a gallery of photos (you can add clothing items to your "wish list"), to a fancy horoscope card. Coincidentally, our first horoscope? "Geek is chic today…" Boy, we sure hope so.
Our first horoscope? "Geek is chic today…"
CNN
CNN offers news alerts on Glass, much like New York Times, but with more customizability. The CNN preference pane lets you pick which topics you’re interested in, set a range of times to receive alerts, and even shows you how many alerts to expect per topic. What sets CNN apart is the video it delivers alongside the report, which loads when you scroll over to it. As bizarre as many of Glass’ functions are, CNN video news pushed to your eyeball really feels like you’re living in the future.

Glassagram
Despite the name, Glassagram isn’t an Instagram-connected service, it’s simply a method to apply Instagram-like filters to your photos before you share them with others. After you install Glassagram, it shows up as a Sharing Contact. Once enabled, it allows you to share a photo with Glassagram, which will then reply with a batch of cropped and filtered photos. You select from one of those photos and share it in turn with another Sharing Contact, like Twitter for instance — it's not elegant, but it works. Too bad Instagram will never see the results.

GlassTweet
While you can’t tweet text, GlassTweet makes it dead simple to tweet photos from Glass’ so-so camera. Once you’ve authorized the app and enabled it as a Sharing Contact, you simply tap to share a photo with it and it’s tweeted with the traditional #throughglass hashtag. The app feels pointless now that there’s an official Twitter app, but as we’ve seen on other platforms, people always like options in their Twitter clients. Perhaps GlassTweet can differentiate itself with the true Twitter killer app we're all waiting for: the one that makes text tweets.

Fullscreen BEAM
This is a YouTube upload app, which adds a Sharing Contact to upload your videos to YouTube through the typical tap-to-share interface. Fullscreen BEAM is one of the few sharing apps with "features," which is to say it has a preferences screen on the website that allows you to choose your timezone, default your videos to public or private, and tweet a link to the video once it’s uploaded.
Upload your videos to YouTube
Glass To Facebook
Like GlassTweet, Glass To Facebook couldn’t be simpler… or more limited. Once enabled, you simply share a photo with Glass To Facebook and it will post the photo to your timeline with a "Posted through Glass" description. Another app made irrelevant by the introduction of official apps.
Couldn't be simpler… or more limited
ThroughGlass
While unofficial, the Facebook updater app ThroughGlass easily outstrips the functionality of Glass’ official Twitter and Facebook apps. The features sound simple and logical enough, but they’re a breath of fresh air on Glass: You can send photos and text status updates to Facebook, and you can also see and reply to comments on the items you post. All you need to do differently is pin the ThroughGlass card so it stays next to your homescreen, ready for your submissions. Hopefully the big boys are taking notes, because so far none of the official sharing apps let you pin them as a card, and we're getting tired of scrolling through our Sharing Contacts.
Reply to Facebook comments on the items you post
Glassnost
Glassnost works exactly like every other single-minded photo upload app, except instead of uploading to Twitter or Facebook, it shares photos to its own nascent Glass-only social network. Perhaps a fully fledged app experience is forthcoming, but for now if you’d like to +1 or comment on a photo, you have to visit Glassnost in a web browser, which sort of defeats the purpose.
Its own nascent Glass-only social network
Glass To Do
A simple to-do list app which installs two cards in your timeline. Glass To Do ’s "Add a New To Do Item" card lets you "reply" to it with a spoken message, which is then added as a to-do item in the "Your To Dos" card — the to-dos are stored in the cloud somewhere, but only accessible from Glass. To complete a task, you simply delete it. Unfortunately, while the "Add" card can be pinned, the list of to-dos doesn’t pop to the front of your timeline when updated, so it’s quickly lost in the hubbub of Glass life. Hopefully that’s a bug, and we’ll keep an eye out for an update.

Thirst
Thirst , a Flipboard-like virtual newspaper already available in web and app form, delivers news that’s trending on social networks, based on which topics you want to track. We set it up to track Google Glass news, naturally, and have received a handful of stories in our timeline over the past two days. Despite the "trending" status, the selections and represented publications feel a little arbitrary, but Thirst makes up for it in quality presentation. With Thirst you can have Glass read an entire article aloud to you, like or dislike the item, and email it to a friend. Only one word of warning: Glass can fall asleep while reading to you, so you’ll need to tap the touchstrip on occasion to keep it awake.
You can have Glass read an entire article aloud to you
Hacks
Hacks
Like all Android devices, Google Glass has a "debug" mode, and once that’s enabled it’s relatively easy to run unapproved apps on your device. Obviously, there’s always the chance you could mess up your unit, but that’s what "Factory Reset" is for, right? At this early stage, you might have to compile these apps yourself, or run them on Glass from the Android development kit, but it’s nothing you can't handle with a couple hours of how-tos and tinkering. There's also a Glass root available, if you're feeling really brave.
Winky
The most controversial and interesting app to come to Glass so far, Winky allows you to take a photo at any time with a simple wink of your right eye. It relies on a little-known "gaze detector" sensor on the inside of Glass’ frame, pointed right at your eye. For a "hack," the app is surprisingly slick and reliable. When it’s first run, Winky offers a configuration screen where you wink a couple times to calibrate Winky’s wink tolerances. From then on, whether Glass is awake or not, a similar exaggerated wink will set it off and a picture will be snapped immediately.

Final thoughts
Final thoughts on first impressions
We know Glass is still in its early stages. We know "the apps aren’t there yet," so we shouldn’t be so quick to judge. We know Google is just getting started with this experiment. Still, as of May 20th, 2013, we can’t help but be judgmental. It’s sort of our job, and so we’ll let you know what we think anyway.
Glass is a slick implementation of the wrong idea. Google has worked so hard at making the device simple that it has succeeded too well — Glass simply can’t do anything Google hasn’t allotted for. Right now there’s little room for innovation by developers, because all third-party apps are trapped in a simple API that’s only capable of pushing and pulling data to and from the device. The API could grow, and Glass doesn't have to be this limited forever, but without the ability to process information on the device, most of the true power of apps on smartphones is lost here. Yes, most of the popular apps on mobile devices are games and social services, but the whole point of a wearable computer is that it should open up new opportunities: augmented reality, serendipity, ways to comprehend your surroundings, way to improve interactions with the people in front of you, and at least some sort of notetaking capability beyond sending emails to yourself. A game like Ingress should be Glass’ killer app, not Google+ sharing. Services like Google Search and Google Now will have to be smarter, not just simpler, on a device like this.
A game like 'Ingress' should be Glass’ killer app, not Google+ sharing
For a device that’s so likely to induce ridicule for the mere fact that you’re wearing a computer on your face, Google seems unconcerned with disabusing people of the notion that you’re a self-absorbed nerd who's fading from reality and becoming part of the Borg. There's not much of a "Hey, look what I can do!" feature, it's more like: "Hang on, let me wait for a push notification."
We expect many of Glass’ practical issues and bugs to fade over time: the lack of an app store, the unreliable connectivity, the constant computer usage required to manage your device, and the confusion between contacts, Sharing Contacts, and apps masquerading as Sharing Contacts. And we have to compliment Google on building a wearable computer that’s truly usable. But when will someone build a wearable computer that’s truly useful?
For now, Glass is the only viable consumer wearable on the horizon, our greatest hope. We’ll be watching carefully, updating often, and installing apps indiscriminately. We want to be proven wrong about Glass, but it just hasn’t happened yet.

By Chris Ziegler 3 hours ago
HTC CEO Peter Chou
The Verge has learned that HTC's Chief Product Officer, Kouji Kodera , left the company last week. Kodera was responsible for HTC's overall product strategy, which makes the departure especially notable on the heels of the global launch of the make-or-break One.
It's not just Kodera. In the past three-odd months, HTC has lost a number of employees in rapid succession — most recently Jason Gordon, the company's vice president of global communications. Other fresh departures include global retail marketing manager Rebecca Rowland, director of digital marketing John Starkweather, and product strategy manager Eric Lin.
It's not a coordinated poaching effort that's draining HTC's Seattle-based North American operations. Starkweather has landed at AT&T, Lin at Skype, and Rowland at Microsoft (Gordon has yet to announce his next move). So why is everyone heading for the door at once?
"Anyone who's heard of them in Seattle doesn't want to go work for them right now. They're like T-Mobile two years ago," one source told us, gesturing to a downtrodden T-Mobile that was hemorrhaging subscribers leading up to AT&T's attempted (and failed) acquisition. "They're in utter freefall."
To all my friends still at @ htc - just quit. leave now. it’s tough to do, but you’ll be so much happier, I swear.
— eric L (@ericlin) May 20, 2013
It's no secret that HTC has seen better days: both last year's One X and this year's One have tried, and thus far failed, to stem flagging revenue against a Samsung giant that dominates Android's market share. But it may not be a coincidence that this year's prominent departures have struck HTC's marketing ranks disproportionately, while the hardware and software design teams — led by Scott Croyle in San Francisico and Drew Bamford in Seattle, respectively — keep humming along. Specifically, sources say that new CMO Ben Ho, who came from Taiwanese carrier FarEasTone late last year, could share the responsibility for the upheaval as he moves some planning and strategy from Seattle back to HTC's Taipei headquarters.
"They're in utter freefall."
Morale may also be drained by the First , the vaunted "Facebook phone" introduced at the social network's April event. According to people briefed on the plans, Facebook had originally signaled its intention to launch the downloadable version of Facebook Home on a significant delay, giving the First some period of exclusivity. Instead, Facebook changed course and made Home available as a Play download the same week that the First launched. Since then, rumors have suggested that the First is hovering near death amid poor sales — rumors bolstered by a quick price cut from $99 to just 99 cents on contract. The phone is "a disaster," one source says.
And then there's Peter Chou, HTC's co-founder and longtime CEO.
Several sources pointed to Chou — who has promised to step down if the flagship One isn't a retail success — as a roadblock, making snap decisions in lieu of a long-term strategy. HTC staff are said to have alerted Chou months ahead of the One's release of possible supply and manufacturing delays, but were told to push ahead anyway. Indeed, the One was saddled with inventory problems after launch , particularly in black, which features an anodized finish that the white and silver model does not.
Those constraints came at a critical time, just as Samsung was shipping its breadwinning Galaxy S4 around the world. If there was a common thread among everyone The Verge spoke with for this story, it was Samsung's brutal dominance: the Korean giant's own-sourced display and processor combined with an enormous marketing war chest make competing in Android extraordinarily difficult, even as reviews have consistently lauded the gorgeous One and bashed the S4's cheap plastic and comparably safe — even boring — design.
HTC's "Facebook phone," the First
Sources tell The Verge that the One was off to a slow start — in part due to the supply issues — but is now gaining steam. Regardless, against the threat of 10 million S4s being sold in a single month , it may not be enough.
What's next for HTC? More upheaval among the ranks, perhaps — and the changes could go all the way to the top if the One isn't a smash hit (provided Chou stays true to his word). In the meantime, the company stands at the center of a triple threat: a Microsoft focused on Nokia, a Facebook focused on distributing Home as widely as possible, and a Samsung focused on dominating the entire Android market.
Shortcuts to mastering the comment thread. Use wisely.

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130515/00554723091/more-details-emerge-key-legal-fight-over-dmca-abuse.shtml|More Details Emerge On Key Legal Fight Over DMCA Abuse
from the oops dept
We recently wrote about a key legal fight over DMCA abuse and whether or not you can expect punishment for bogus DMCA takedowns under 512(f).  The fact that even the MPAA has weighed in to make sure that there are basically no remedies for its faulty DMCA notices suggests how important this fight is -- even though at its core it appears to be a silly petty squabble among two bloggers who clearly hate each other.  You can read back over the previous posts to get the details, but a few details have come out since the last filing, which may be quite relevant.
Gina Crosley-Corcoran's (the blogger who filed the DMCA notices) filing against Amy Tuteur (the blogger who sued claiming a DMCA 512(f) violation) made a few claims that, if true, would likely weaken Tuteur's case dramatically.  The key claims were that neither of the hosts that Tuteur said had removed her blog/account had actually done so.  Without the actual removal or loss of account, Tuteur's overall claim is much weaker, since some cases have argued that you can only win a 512(f) case if the content was actually removed in reaction to the DMCA notices.  Crosley-Corcoran's filing claimed that the first hosting company, BlueHost, never took down the content or the account, but that Tuteur chose to switch accounts, saying that BlueHost only warned that it could take down the content or shut down her account, but that it did not.  However, Tuteur has posted to her own blog a screenshot from Crosley-Corocran's own blog that includes not just a screenshot of Tuteur's blog being shutdown on BlueHost, but also where Crosley-Corcoran brags about BlueHost taking down the entire blog.  So... for Crosley-Corcoran to claim in her filing that BlueHost didn't take down the site, when Crosley-Corcoran's own statements show that it did... I can't imagine that will go over well in court.
Next up was the second host, Daring Host.  Crosley-Corcoran's filing includes the claim that Daring Host told Tuteur it had to cancel her account due to being unable to handle the traffic, not because of the DMCA issue.  It even provided a deposition from the owner of Daring Host claiming that he was clear to Tuteur that it was the traffic issue, not the DMCA notice, that resulted in the closing of the account.  Except... Tuteur has now posted an original email from Daring Host to her about the closing of the account, where it's quite clear that a key reason was the possible liability from the DMCA notice.
Amy,
I spoke with the lawyer I’ve used with my businesses earlier today about the situation with your website and it being targeted. He informed me that hosting your website is a liability on a few different levels which is a risk to my business. While I support your cause and understand the situation you are in, I will no longer be able to host your website due to the risk and liability it poses to my business.
I do not want to leave you and your website out in the cold because I can understand that fighting against the people who are targeting you is not an easy task. I have done some research for you and found a couple of different businesses that should be able to host your website better in terms of dealing with it being targeted.
The first host I’ve found is called Alibabahost.com. On their website they state “AlibabaHost provides freedom of content and speech. Regarding the DMCA complains, we forward them to you and you decide how to proceed next.”
Considering the only legal liability that had come up had been the DMCA notice, combined with the fact that he directly highlights how the first host he suggests handles DMCA complaints, it seems pretty clear that the DMCA takedowns and further threats of more takedowns was a (if not "the") driving force behind telling her to look elsewhere.  Given that the deposition from the same owner, Nick Esposito, appears to conflict with what he directly told Tuteur, he may face some interesting questions as well from the court.
For what it's worth, Crosley-Corcoran appears to have shown up in our comments on the last post claiming :
I did not "brag" about my DMCA taking down her site. In fact, the court has the evidence (submitted by her side, ironically) showing me saying that I, quote, "wish I could take credit, but this was more than me." I knew then that the host did not take action to remove her site because of my DMCA, and she knew it too.
Given the screenshot above, this appears to be wholly untrue.  She does appear to have very clearly bragged about the DMCA notice taking down her site.  Also, there was a Facebook post from Crosley-Corcoran that talked excitedly about how she was spending the "legal fund" that she had solicited from her readers to help take down the site from Daring Host, and: "if she keeps on doing what she's doing, this will keep happening."
Also, while it's cut off at the end of that screenshot above, that original post from Crosley-Corcoran appears to clearly admit that she's using the DMCA notice not to stop copyright infringement, but to silence protected speech:
She could owe me statutory damages, but because I'm a fair and reasonable human being, my attorney and I felt it was best to discuss a non-monetary settlement with Amy and her lawyer. I'm not looking to be greedy — I simply wanted a resolution. In exchange for me not pursuing the damages, we wanted Amy to agree to stop personally attacking me. It was that simple.
Combine all of that, and it seems like a pretty strong argument that Crosley-Corcoran used the DMCA to silence criticism, rather than for stopping copyright infringement, and that she knew and celebrated that fact publicly, contrary to what she stated in her filing and in our comments.

from the stifling-innovation dept
We've seen this over and over again: new and innovative startups enter a market in a creative and compelling way, and a combination of incumbents and regulators get in the way of something cool happening.  Perhaps the most well known recent example of this is with Uber , but probably a close second is Airbnb.  Airbnb is the immensely popular system for letting people rent out their homes/apartments/spare rooms to willing guests for (usually) short stays.  Completely coincidentally, just this morning, I tried Airbnb for the very first time, trying to book a stay in Manhattan for an upcoming trip.  And... soon after I submitted my request, I saw this report that officials in New York City have deemed Airbnb to violate the city's "illegal hotel law." Basically, they're arguing that people renting out their homes are running illegal hotels.  They originally asked the guy who rented his condo out to pay $7,000 for both violating that law and for zoning and building code violations, but then dropped the latter part, and lowered the fine to $2,400 for just the hotel part.
Of course, laws like the illegal hotel law are supposed to be about public safety, and to maintain certain health and safety standards.  But, the reality is that, like so much regulation these days, it's turned into a way to keep competition out .  Laws to protect hotel visitors certainly made some amount of sense in the past, but most of the reasons why they're in place don't necessarily apply to the way Airbnb functions.  Because we can now share information pretty easily, Airbnb's detailed review system and communication process take away most of the "risk" that necessitated a health and safety law.
Just as an example, in my own search for a place to stay, I went through about half a dozen different apartments that were available, and looked over the pictures and carefully read the reviews.  I immediately discounted the cheapest one, because multiple reviews mentioned that the apartment had not been cleaned prior to them showing up.  Information and the sharing of information made that place undesirable just like that.  No laws needed.  I also emailed back and forth with a few other apartment/condo owners to find out some details about their places, before finally selecting one that worked for me.  Honestly, the experience has been awesome so far, giving me much greater choice, and the likelihood of a much nicer stay than in a hotel.
The new ruling doesn't suddenly make Airbnb itself "illegal," but does suggest that if the city finds out that you're using the service, you could face stiff fines.  At the heart of the issue is a really stupid law that was basically designed to make Airbnb impossible: it says you can't rent out your place for less than 29 days .  The only purpose of this law is to protect hotels from competition.  The backer of the law claims that it was really about landlords illegally converting residential buildings into hotels, but if that was the case, they should have made the bill a lot clearer, because it's being used to punish this Airbnb user.  Airbnb, which tried to intervene in the case, is (quite reasonably) disappointed:
This decision runs contrary to the stated intention and the plain text of New York law, so obviously we are disappointed. But more importantly, this decision makes it even more critical that New York law be clarified to make sure regular New Yorkers can occasionally rent out their own homes. There is universal agreement that occasional hosts like Nigel Warren were not the target of the 2010 law, but that agreement provides little comfort to the handful of people, like Nigel, who find themselves targeted by overzealous enforcement officials. It is time to fix this law and protect hosts who occasionally rent out their own homes. Eighty-seven percent of Airbnb hosts in New York list just a home they live in -- they are average New Yorkers trying to make ends meet, not illegal hotels that should be subject to the 2010 law.
As the reports note, this doesn't mean that the city will now be going after the tens of thousands of residents who rent their places out on Airbnb, but if complaints are filed, it can go after them.  Hopefully, this doesn't scare off the person whose house I just requested... But, more importantly, this shows, yet again, why bad regulations can do serious harm to innovation, often while serving to protect less innovative incumbents.

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039368/awesome-video-shows-leap-motions-windows-8-gesture-control-capabilities.html|Awesome video shows Leap Motion's Windows 8 gesture control capabilities
Leap Motion doesn't have to replace your PC's mouse, but it certainly can.
A new video from Leap shows how hand and finger gestures may be used to point, click, zoom, and scroll your way through Windows 8. Although Leap wants developers to create applications specifically for the 3D motion controller, mouse emulation will allow the controller to work across entire Windows operating system, even with legacy software.
However, it's hard to tell from the video exactly how the motion controls work. A simple nudge forward with an outstretched finger appears to simulate a mouse click, and pinch gestures control zooming, but it seems there are some subtle differences between pointing, scrolling and dragging that are tough to discern from the video. (We've reached out to Leap to see if we can find out more about specific gestures.)
In any case, if mouse emulation works as advertised, it could make Windows 8 more enjoyable on desktop PCs, especially those without touch screens. Users will be able to simulate touch input on modern-style applications while leaning back, possibly avoiding the dreaded gorilla arm that comes from reaching out over a desk.
Leap had originally planned to ship its motion controller on May 19, but last month company decided to push the ship date back to July 22. Leap said it was behind schedule, and needed more time to polish its software.
(Click to enlarge.)
The hardware, which is roughly the size of two outstretched fingers and detects 3D motion in the surrounding 8 cubic feet, will cost $80 at retail. That's a whole heck of a lot cheaper than a Windows 8-certified touchscreen desktop monitor, which typically retail for around $500—and the Leap Motion even includes multi-monitor support with a single unit.
Leap is taking pre-orders on its Website, and Best Buy plans to sell the product in its stores. Later this year, both Asus and HP will bundle Leap with select PCs , and HP will eventually embed the technology in unannounced devices.

Amazon proposes a colossal biospherelike Seattle campus
Forget the Space Needle, the e-commerce giant is planning to bring 3.3 million square feet of office space to Seattle in the form of mirrored towers and giant spherical domes filled with plant life.

The latest fad for tech companies' new office buildings seems to involve making them as far-out and avant-garde as possible. And Amazon is the newest firm to jump on that train.
The e-commerce giant and gadget maker unveiled a slew of new drawings ( PDF ) on Tuesday that reveal a series of colossal, mirrored, biospherelike domes alongside a taller rectangular building that could be its new campus. The designs were created by architecture firm NBBJ and also include a copious amount of green space and landscaping.
The intent behind the design, according to the project proposal ( PDF ), is to "create an alternative environment" where "employees can work and socialize in a more natural, parklike setting."
"The generative idea is that a plant-rich environment has many positive qualities that are not often found in a typical office setting," the proposal says. "While the form of the building will be visually reminiscent of a greenhouse or conservatory, plant material will be selected for its ability to co-exist in a microclimate that also suits people."

Google flexes its Googleplex with planned expansion
According to the proposal, the offices will have in-house dining, meeting, and lounge spaces, as well as a "a variety of botanical zones modeled on...ecologies found around the globe." In all, the designs for the campus include 3.3 million square feet of office space, with three 37-story office towers. The three massive spheres will range from 80 to 95 feet high.
Amazon has been planning to expand its offices for a while. The company plunked down $1.16 billion for 1.8 million square feet of new office space in Seattle last October. The design proposal for its new campus is to be discussed Tuesday evening at a Design Review Board meeting at Seattle's City Hall.
While Amazon's design is unconventional, to say the least, the company is one of several tech firms to have proposed such futuristic and nature-friendly office buildings as of late. Apple is working on getting designs for a low-level, circular, spaceshiplike headquarters approved in Cupertino, Calif.; and Facebook is in the process of breaking ground on its swanky second campus in Menlo Park, Calif., which is a long, narrow, rooftop-gardened building designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry.
Here are some more images of the proposed design for Amazon's campus:

Audi PR Loses Its Mind Over Tesla Model S (UPDATE: Audi pulls post from net…but we still have it)
16 hours ago by Jay Cole 6
In April, Audi Sold 1,462 Of Its Flagship A8, A Couple Hundred Less Than Tesla Averaged With The Model S In The First Quarter Or 2013
Quite possibly on their way out of the office last Friday, the Audi PR department put out a “hit” on the Tesla Model S, by penning an article entitled:
“Not so fast to put Tesla on that particular pedestal“
In a nutshell, before turning out the lights for the weekend, Audi was trying to get ahead of a CNNMoney article that says the Tesla Model S is outselling many of the larger, more established nameplates’ high end vehicles, or in Audi’s case, the A8.
Even If The Audi Media Department Got Their Fact-Checking Right, Is This The Kind Of PR That Is Good For The German Company?
And while Audi makes some salient points, most specifically that the title of CNN’s piece “Tesla sales beating Mercedes, BMW and Audi” is giving consumers the impression that the Model S, as a single car, is outselling the entire Audi lineup (which it is not), the whole Audi retort to a 3rd party news story reeks of the high road not taken.
Audi is fighting the wind here if you will.  And not doing a particularly decent job of it.
Why would the 104 year old company (the last 47 as a subsidiary of VW) want to even comment on this piece?  And why so heavy handed, calling into question Tesla’s long-term viability?
“To be sure, Tesla has been riding a boom in investor and consumer interest based on its apparent ability crack the code for EV sales with its $70,000-and-up Model S.  But while Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk has raised Model S sales estimates for 2013 to 21,000 units, the brand faces a number of long-term issues that also were noted this week by American press.”
But more than all of this, should not Audi do a little fact-checking of their own before calling out someone else on responsible journalism?
“But the fact is that Tesla’s reported sales of 4,750 units of its Model S electric car in April were less than half of Audi of America sales of 13,157 vehicles in the month, which represented a 16-percent rise from a year earlier. BMW and Mercedes-Benz sold even more than that.”
Fact is, Tesla likely only sold a little more than a third the number of Model S electric sedans that the German company reported for them in April, as Audi used an old Tesla sales estimate of 4,750-odd cars for the first quarter as a jumping off point for their statement; that is of course before Tesla reported actual sales of  4,900 sold during the first three months of the year  a couple weeks ago.
One would assume if Audi was going to get the first three months of the year confused with April, they would at least use actual Tesla sales results somewhere in the calculation.  Also, of interest Audi only sold 467 A8s in April of 2013, not the 1,462 they mention in the press release…that is actually their sales from January to March.
Basically, the Audi intern (who we can assume wrote this press release) wanted to turn the tables on the California start-up, and use Audi’s April sales of all their models to compare to Tesla’s Model S sedan’s single April sales result (which aren’t publicly available) to illustrate itheir point, but ended up using a two month old estimated data point for the 1st quarter in lieu of any actual figures that might make the comparison somewhat poignant.

Teenagers really are over Facebook. In February the social network warned investors that "our younger users ... are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, Facebook." And in April the investment bank Piper Jaffray reported that products and services like Tumblr and Twitter were further eroding Facebook's dominance among the Justin Bieber set. But why? In a deep report published on Tuesday, Pew Research explains that teenagers departing the social network's blue confines are looking for something more... real. More authentic. Which, ironically, was the initial draw of Facebook, one of the first social networks to require real names .
Pew shows how Facebook has been slowly colonized by the very forces teens signed up to escape: watchful parents, too-old adults, and "drama" — nasty conversations that would never arise in real life. To contend with these annoying developments, teens aren't deleting their Facebook accounts; they're just using them less and less, spending more time on Twitter and Instagram, where conservations are limited to short-form text, links, and simple photos; or Tumblr, which emphasizes content over consolidated user profiles. Here's how one (anonymous) interviewee put it to Pew during a focus group :
Female (age 15): “I have a Facebook, a Tumblr, and Twitter. I don’t use Facebook or Twitter much. I rather use Tumblr to look for interesting stories. I like Tumblr because I don’t have to present a specific or false image of myself and I don’t have to interact with people I don’t necessarily want to talk to.”
Indeed, teenagers have become acutely aware of how social media alters our understanding of human identity. When asked to discuss Facebook's shortcomings, another pair of teens explained:
Female (age 14): "OK, here's something I want to say. I think Facebook can be fun, but also it's drama central. On Facebook, people imply things and say things, even just by a like, that they wouldn't say in real life."
Male (age 18): “It’s because [Facebook] it's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things, like saying he has a girlfriend, and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like, me and him in the sun having fun. Why would you do that?”
"Where people post unnecessary pictures and say unnecessary things" is probably not the slogan Facebook was hoping for, especially among such an impressionable demographic. But it's probably music to Marissa Mayer's ears — Yahoo's $1.1 billion deal for Tumblr is being seen as something of a sea change in social media from what The New York Times described in today's paper as a "passive" kind of "social directory," as opposed to, say, Tumblr, one of many sites that have "come up with ways to let people control and generate content and project identity." Because that's, you know, a little bit more real these days.

from the call-in-time dept
We recently wrote about a bill being introduced in Congress that would help fix the DMCA by making a very minor, but important, set of changes to the anti-circumvention clauses of the DMCA.  As you may recall, Section 1201 of the law says that it's against copyright law to circumvent "technological measures" designed to prevent you from accessing something, even if the purpose of bypassing those measures is not to actually infringe on any copyright.  That's why we end up with crazy situations like it being illegal to "unlock" your mobile phone.  A bipartisan group of Representatives have introduced this new bill, the Unlocking Technology Act ( HR 1892 ), which makes it clear that if you circumvent technological protection measures to do something that doesn't infringe, then that, itself, is not a violation of copyright law.  This doesn't "weaken" copyrights in any way.  Those who break DRM to infringe are still violating this clause.  All it does is stop the absurd situation where you are found to "violate" copyright law despite not infringing on anyone's copyright.
It's difficult to think of any reason why this bill shouldn't become law.
And, of course, because of that, there's an uphill battle to get Congress to actually support it.  FixTheDMCA -- the group that first put forth the petition that got the White House to agree that you should be able to unlock your mobile phones -- is now running a call-in campaign , asking people to call their Congressional representatives, to let them know that they should support the bill.
It's a pretty simple question: do you actually own the products you buy?  Most people think that they do, but under the current text of Section 1201, the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA, you don't.  Here's a chance to fix that basic premise and to make it clear you own what you buy.  Seems like something Congress should easily support, so now might be a good time to let them know that.

The idea of vertical farming is all the rage right now. Architects and engineers have come up with spectacular concepts for lofty buildings that could function as urban food centers of the future.

In Sweden, for example, they're planning a 177-foot skyscraper to farm leafy greens at the edge of each floor. But so far, most vertical gardens that are up and running actually look more like large greenhouses than city towers. And many horticulturists don't think sky-high farms in cities are practical.
"The idea of taking a skyscraper and turning it into a vertical farming complex is absolutely ridiculous from an energy perspective," says horticulturist Cary Mitchell of Purdue University, who's been working on ways to grow plants in space for more than 20 years.
The future of vertical farming, Mitchell thinks, lies not in city skyscrapers, but rather in large warehouses located in the suburbs, where real estate and electricity are cheaper.
And oh, yeah, instead of being traditional greenhouses lit by fluorescent lamps, he says these plant factories will probably be "pinkhouses," glowing magenta from the mix of blue and red LEDs.
Light is a major problem with vertical farming. When you stack plants on top of each other, the ones at the top shade the ones at the bottom. The only way to get around it is to add artificial light — which is expensive both financially and environmentally.
Vertical farmers can lower the energy bill, Mitchell says, by giving plants only the wavelengths of light they need the most: the blue and red.
"Twenty years ago, research showed that you could grow lettuce in just red light," Mitchell says. "If you add a little bit of blue, it grows better."
Plant's photosynthesis machinery is tuned to absorb red and blue light most efficiently. They have a handful of other pigments in their leaves that catch other wavelengths, but the red and blue wavelengths are the big ones, supplying the majority of the light needed to grow.

So why LEDs? They're super energy efficient in general, but unlike traditional greenhouse lamps, they can be tuned to specific wavelengths. Why use all of ROYGBIV when just RB will do?
And there's another advantage to using LEDs in greenhouses and vertical farming, Mitchell says: Because these lights are cooler, you can place them close to the plants — even stacked plants — and lose even less energy.
Recently, Mitchell and his graduate student designed a 9-foot-tall tower of lights and grew tomato plants right up against it. "As the plants get taller, we turn on the [light] panels higher up," he explains. "It takes about two months before all the panels are on."
The towers cut energy consumption by about 75 percent, Mitchell and his team reported earlier this year.
Right now, experiments are using these specialized LEDs to supplement natural light, not replace it.
But as LEDs get more and more efficient, could growers forgo the natural light altogether and grow crops completely in enclosed rooms, where they're protected from temperature changes or damaging pests?
That's exactly what Barry Holtz, at Caliber Biotherapeutics , is already doing.
His farms have never seen the light of day.
Plants at Caliber Biotherapeutics grow under blue and red LEDs, with wavelengths of light that match those that get absorbed by the photosynthetic machinery.

He and his company have built a 150,000-square-foot "plant factory" in Texas that is completely closed off from the outside world. They grow 2.2 million plants, stacked up 50 feet high, all underneath the magenta glow of blue and red LEDS.
"A photon is a terrible thing to waste," Holtz tells The Salt. "So we developed these lights to correctly match the photosynthesis needs of our plants. We get almost 20 percent faster growth rate and save a lot energy."
Holtz is growing a tobacco-like plant to make new drugs and vaccines. The indoor pinkhouse gives him tight control over the expensive crops, so his team can stop diseases and contamination.
Holtz says this type of indoor gardening isn't going to replace traditional farms anytime soon. It's still relatively expensive for growing food. "We couldn't compete with iceberg lettuce farmers," he says, "but for certain specialty crops, the economics wouldn't be so bad."
And, he says, the pinkhouse is actually quite efficient when it comes to water and electricity. "We've done some calculations, and we lose less water in one day than a KFC restaurant uses, because we recycle all of it."

(Eesha Khare (18) of California…)
WASHINGTON: Teenagers of Indian origin won a raft of prizes at the annual Intel science bash in what's now par for course, but although the top prize eluded them, the most electrifying breakthrough came from Indian-American high-schooler. A device she has developed can fully charge a cell phone in 20 to 30 seconds in what will be a boon for a gazillion mobile users who need to juice up their cell phones quickly.
Eesha Khare, 18, of Saratoga , California received the Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award of $50,000 for developing a fast-charging supercapacitor that fits inside a cell phone, charge the battery in under a minute, and hold it for long. Khare says the device will also result in batteries that can last for 10,000 charge-recharge cycles, compared with 1,000 cycles for conventional rechargeable batteries.
"My cellphone battery always dies," she told journalists in Phoenix where the annual Intel science fiesta for young gearheads took place last week, in an obvious explanation for why she had worked on energy-storage technology, besides the fact that it allowed her to focus on her interest in nanochemistry. She said the technology also has potential applications for car batteries and other devices, while declaring she will be going to Harvard this fall to pursue research in nanochemistry.
Neither Eesha nor Intel offered any details of the breakthrough, which if validated, would be worth tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars, revolutionizing battery technology across the board, from mobile devices to computers and cars. The award cited Eesha for "Design and Synthesis of Hydrogenated TiO2-Polyaniline Nanorods for Flexible High-Performance," geek-speak for developing a new kind of supercapacitor. Typically, supercapacitors have higher energy density than conventional batteries.
To think that phone and battery companies would have overlooked the magic bullet of fast charging battery, manna to all gadget junkies, seems almost inconceivable, but to paraphrase the popular tv program of yesteryears: Kids to the darnedest things.
Meantime, the top prize of $ 75,000, called the Gordon Moore Award after Intel's legendary co-founder, went to Ionut Budisteanu, 19, of Romania for using artificial intelligence to create a viable model for a low-cost, self-driving car. The teenager's work found wide appreciation for addressing a major global issue. In 2004, car accidents caused 2.5 million deaths worldwide and 87 percent of crashes resulted from driver error.
With 3-D radar and mounted cameras, Ionut created a feasible design for an autonomously controlled car that could detect traffic lanes and curbs, along with the real-time position of the car - and it would only cost $4,000. Again, this is something many companies, notably Google, has been working on. But the technology from established companies is expected to be far more expensive.
Indian teens also won other prizes, including the top prize for mathematical sciences going to Vinay Iyengar and the top prize for environmental sciences going to Naomi Shah, both of Portland, Oregon.

VMware finds a way to wring more cash out of virtualization customers.
by Jon Brodkin - May 21, 2013 10:30 pm UTC
Ruslan Rugoals
VMware today unveiled its first public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud product, putting the virtualization software vendor into direct competition with Amazon Web Services. When combined with its in-house software, VMware's cloud also provides an alternative to the virtualization/cloud synergy Microsoft is trying to achieve with Hyper-V, Windows Server, and Windows Azure.
Like Amazon and other IaaS providers, VMware's public cloud will offer access to virtual computing resources hosted in data centers in four US regions (with non-US data centers coming next year). VMware's biggest opportunity probably isn't in stealing customers away from Amazon or Microsoft, however. Rather, the VMware cloud will likely appeal the most to businesses with big VMware deployments—this is a strategy to wring more money out of customers already paying a premium for virtualization software.
VMware's cloud could be used by customers without any VMware software in-house, but it will be more useful to businesses that can use the cloud as a logical extension of their own VMware-driven data centers. The VMware cloud's name, " vCloud Hybrid Service ," reflects the customer base it will most likely attract.
VMware's US-based services will be available to early access customers in June and will be generally available in the third quarter of this year from data centers in Santa Clara, CA; Dallas, TX; Las Vegas, NV; and Sterling, VA. Services will be offered from data centers in Asia and the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) sometime in 2014. Customers outside the US aren't prohibited from using the US-based services, but they would have to handle some latency.
Compute capacity will be offered in two varieties, one on dedicated hardware and another on shared hardware. Minimum configurations for multi-tenant instances (called a "Virtual Private Cloud") are 20GB of virtual RAM, 5GHz CPU power (with a "burst" to 10GHz), 2TB of storage, 10Mbps bandwidth, and two public IP addresses. Customers can manage this capacity from a Web interface using management tools similar to what's found in VMware's on-premises software. Pricing for customers who sign contracts of three to 12 months is as follows:
That's discounted pricing for subscriptions. Customers will have to pay more for shorter-term deals or one-time uses.
VMware's "Dedicated Cloud" instances require 1- to 3-year contracts and start at 120GB of virtual RAM, 30GHz of CPU power, 6TB storage, and 50Mbps bandwidth. Pricing is as follows:
VMware
The pricing does not include the cost of operating system licenses and looks to be less flexible than Amazon's , but that's likely not a problem when it comes to attracting users already locked in to VMware's vSphere virtualization and data center management platform. By using vSphere in combination with vCloud Hybrid Service, customers will be able to spin up new applications in the cloud using vSphere, or they can add capacity to applications without buying more hardware for their own data centers. Applications can draw from resources both in a customer's data center and in a VMware data center and appear to be on the same network.
On its own, VMware's vCloud Hybrid Service is more analogous to Amazon's cloud than Microsoft's because it offers pure infrastructure rather than a platform optimized for developers to build and host new applications. Windows Azure began as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud only, just recently expanding to include  infrastructure-as-a-service .
"You don't actually have to buy vSphere unless you were going to deploy an on-premises environment. You could just buy the off-premises vCloud Hybrid Service," VMware Director of Partner Strategy Mercer Rowe told Ars. However, the real value is derived by combining on-premises and cloud-based deployments and managing them from the same interface, he said. That's similar to how Microsoft's on-premises software can be used in conjunction with Azure.
"You can stretch your Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks seamlessly from your data center to vCloud Hybrid Service without the need for manual configuration changes," a VMware product sheet states. "Network virtualization enables you to configure your firewalls and network as if they were in your own data center so that you can replicate the network your applications need to operate. The service provides common identity and access management across your onsite and offsite cloud locations."
VMware said there are 3,700 applications certified to run on vSphere and vCloud Hybrid Service. vCloud Hybrid Service can run any of the " more than 90 operating systems " already certified to run on vSphere.
Rather than sell virtual machines preloaded with operating system images, VMware "sells pools of compute resources (RAM and CPU) to the customer and allows them to create VMs based on their needs," a company spokesperson told Ars. Customers can use their own OS images or use templates from VMware's catalog, which includes Windows and Linux configurations. "VMware will be reselling OS and application licensing for VMs generated out of the global VMware catalog where needed," the company said.
In other words, the prices can't be easily compared to Amazon's, which sells VMs preloaded with operating systems and includes the licensing cost in the advertised price .
VMware said it is also teaming with SAP to offer hosted versions of the company's enterprise applications, including the HANA database.
VMware’s other competition—its own partners
While this is the first IaaS cloud offered by VMware directly to customers, it's not the first cloud service based on VMware software. VMware has been selling cloud infrastructure software to service providers for several years, meaning the vCloud Hybrid Service is potentially a competitor to VMware's own partners such as AT&T and Verizon's Terremark.
VMware is trying to soften the blow by working with partners to help them offer add-on services for vCloud Hybrid Service, such as consulting and management. VMware will also make the underlying vCloud Hybrid Service technology available to providers so they can build new cloud services of their own, perhaps targeted to specific industries or geographic regions. VMware partners also offer network and colocation services that might differ from VMware-branded-services, Rowe said.
"We don't expect a significant movement [of customers from VMware partners to vCloud Hybrid Service]," Rowe said. "We believe the customers obtaining value from VMware products with our service provider partners will continue to be customers of theirs."
VMware also has a hosted platform-as-a-service cloud called Cloud Foundry, which is mostly for creating new applications rather than putting existing ones in the cloud. VMware and its owner, EMC, recently spun out Cloud Foundry and several other cloud and big data business units into a new subsidiary called " Pivotal ."
VMware has plenty of cloudy competition in addition to Amazon and Microsoft. Besides longstanding IaaS vendors like Rackspace and GoGrid, Google offers App Engine and Compute Engine to cover both the PaaS and IaaS markets.

IBM spoke of shrinking its intelligent supercomputer Watson down to smartphone size last summer, and now it appears that the company is getting close to achieving that goal. Watson , which gained notoriety by famously trouncing two champions on Jeopardy, will not initially come to smartphones as a stand-alone app like Siri or Google Now, though it could eventually give both services a run for their money. Instead, IBM will partner with a number of companies including ANZ Bank, Nielsen, Celcom, IHS, and Royal Bank of Canada, Forbes reports  to have Watson power customer service systems for these companies. Watson will initially be accessible though Web chats, email, smartphone apps and SMS, and voice recognition functionality is expected to come in future versions of the offering. Apps that include this new “Ask Watson” feature are expected to begin rolling out in the next few months.

http://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11535|Revolutionary Muon Experiment to Begin With 3,200-mile Move of 50-Foot-Wide Particle Storage Ring
Massive device will travel from New York to Illinois by barge and truck this summer
May 8, 2013
The Muon g-2 storage ring, in its current location at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The ring, which will capture muons in a magnetic field, must be transported in one piece, and moved flat to avoid undue pressure on the superconducting cable inside.
Scientists from 26 institutions around the world are planning a new experiment that could open the doors to new realms of particle physics. But first, they have to bring the core of this experiment, a complex electromagnet that spans 50 feet in diameter, from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York to the DOE's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.
The experiment is called Muon g-2 (pronounced gee-minus-two), and will study the properties of muons, tiny subatomic particles that exist for only 2.2 millionths of a second. The core of the experiment is a machine built at Brookhaven in the 1990s, and the centerpiece of that machine is a circular electromagnet made of steel and aluminum, 50 feet wide, with superconducting cable inside. 
"It costs about 10 times less to move the magnet from Brookhaven to Illinois than it would to build a new one," said Lee Roberts of Boston University, spokesperson for the Muon g-2 experiment. "So that's what we're going to do. It's an enormous effort from all sides, but it will be worth it." 
A model of the truck that will be used to transport the Muon g-2 ring, placed on a streetscape for scale. The truck will be escorted by police and other vehicles when it moves from Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York to a barge, and then from the barge to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois. Credit: Fermilab
While most of the machine can be disassembled and brought to Fermilab in trucks, the massive electromagnet must be transported in one piece. It also cannot tilt or twist more than a few degrees, or the complex wiring inside will be irreparably damaged. The Muon g-2 team has devised a plan to make the 3,200-mile journey that involves loading the ring onto a specially prepared barge and bringing it down the East Coast, around the tip of Florida and up the Mississippi River to Illinois.
The ring is expected to leave New York in early June, and land in Illinois in late July. Once it arrives, the ring will be placed onto a truck built just for this purpose, and driven to Fermilab in Batavia, a suburb of Chicago. The land transport portions on both the New York and Illinois ends of the trip will occur at night — to minimize traffic delays — and the truck will only travel, at most, 10 miles per hour. On the New York end, the trip from Brookhaven Lab's gate to the departure port should take one night. The complete trip from the Illinois port to Fermilab should take two consecutive nights.

 "The transport of the ring from Brookhaven to Fermilab is a great example of the cooperation that exists between national laboratories," said James Siegrist, associate director of science for high-energy physics with the U.S. Department of Energy. "The Muon g-2 experiment is an important component of the future of particle physics in the United States."
Once at Fermilab, the storage ring will be used to hold muons created in the laboratory's accelerators. Muons "wobble" when placed in a magnetic field, and based on what we know about the universe, scientists have predicted the exact value of that wobble. An experiment using the same machine at Brookhaven in the 1990s saw evidence for – though not definitive proof of – a departure from that expected value.
"Fermilab can generate a much more intense and pure beam of muons, so the Muon g-2 experiment should be able to close that margin of error," said Chris Polly, project manager for Fermilab. "If we can do that, this experiment could indicate that there is exciting science awaiting beyond what we have observed."
The experiment is scheduled to begin taking data in 2016. 
"The ring is a wonder of scientific engineering," said William Morse of Brookhaven. "We're extremely proud of it, and excited to see it used in this next-generation experiment."

http://mashable.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-apple-tv/|Did Microsoft Just Kick Apple Out of the Living Room?
2.2k
2013-05-21 22:23:19 UTC
If you want to see what the Apple TV will look like, I hope you were tuned to Spike at about 1 p.m. Eastern today, because we got a pretty solid picture of the rumored device: a powerful all-in-one entertainment hub with a hands-free interface that smartly integrates live TV with a wealth of streaming and downloadable media.
I'm speaking, of course, of the Xbox One , Microsoft's freshly unveiled new game console. Except it's so much more than a game console. The Xbox One is intended to be the command center for any and all media you experience through a TV screen. Sure, the Xbox 360 already had that job, but the One is a considerable upgrade.
First of all, Microsoft uses a genius interface: your voice. While voice commands on mobile devices (exemplified by Siri) are often inappropriate for many situations, they make a lot more sense when you're sitting on the couch in the privacy of your home.
Cracking the Interface
Microsoft debuted voice control on the first Kinect, but now it's bundled the Kinect with the console and improved and expanded its abilities. During Tuesday's big reveal, Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi told the Xbox One to "Watch TV," "Game" and "Go to Music." The machine responded as fast as a human, and in a smart manner — when Mehdi said "Watch ESPN," it obeyed without Mehdi ever needing to know the channel number.
Then there were the gestures, which Microsoft has also expanded in the Xbox One. Miming a "grab the screen" movement, Mehdi was able to immediately go back to the Xbox home screen. Reverse the movement, and the content goes back to full-screen. Nice.
Yes, it was a canned demo, and we should know a little better how well the Xbox One really works after Mashable editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff has some hands-on time. However, the promise is great, particularly the seemingly seamless integration of live TV. An interface this intuitive and fast borders on — dare I say it? — magic.
After seeing the how the Xbox One will work, it makes me wonder what Apple has left to do. Before he died, Steve Jobs famously said that he had finally "cracked" the interface for a connected television. But that was two years ago. Technology has progressed considerably, and Microsoft is now turning its living-room beachhead into full-on invasion.
Xbox Won?
Of course, it remains to be seen how good the live TV integration is. Mehdi showed how it would work with his Comcast feed, but Comcast has a deal with Microsoft on the Xbox. With other providers, the experience might not be as seamless. Voice control is also a very finicky technology, with other attempts to integrate it with TVs falling flat .
From the Xbox One reveal, though, Microsoft appears to have a big lead on anyone else in those areas, and a platform that's already in millions of people's homes. If Apple is going to convince customers it has a better experience, it's going to have to deliver an interface that's even easier to use, integration with better services and more content that people want.
Factor in the Xbox One's support for Blu-ray, 4K and 3D as well as all the content already on the platform, and the deck is even more stacked in Microsoft's favor. Then there's the very smart Skype integration, a service whose platform-agnostic nature gives it a big leg-up on Apple's FaceTime.
If there's one thing holding back the Xbox from taking over everyone's living room, it's prejudice against gaming consoles, and Microsoft didn't do itself any favors by broadcasting the unveiling on the notorious Spike TV. Just minutes before the Xbox broadcast, the channel showed a program depicting a full-on (though not fully graphic) masturbation sequence. Not exactly the best lead-in for a device if it wants to go mainstream.
Despite the facepalm moment, the Xbox is doing just that ( more people now buy it or general entertainment than games). With the Xbox One, Microsoft has the goods to offer something new and improved to anyone who is interested in digital media — even if they never fire up even one game.
Yes, the Apple iTV is probably real, it's probably coming in the next year, and it'll probably soon be in many homes. And right underneath it you'll probably find an Xbox One.

http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4353232/kinect-xbox-one-hands-on|The all-seeing Kinect: tracking my face, arms, body, and heart on the Xbox One
By David Pierce 8 hours ago
"It's what's on the inside that counts" is something of an unofficial mantra of Microsoft's new Xbox One . The Kinect is perhaps the best example: externally, it's more or less unchanged from its predecessor, but it's actually a very different device. It's been upgraded in a huge way, but the end result is simple: the Kinect just sees more. (And hears more , but that's another matter.)
It has an ultra-wide 1080p camera (which should mean the Xbox One doesn't require such a large room), which easily picked up all of the dozen or so people sitting in the "living room" testing lab on Microsoft's campus. Kinect can even see in the dark, thanks to an infrared sensor that engages when the primary camera can't see anything. Along with higher-end processing power and a host of new software, Kinect feels a bit like it's gone from usable prototype to real, legitimate product.
Kinect has always been able to tell that you're moving. But now it can tell if you're moving your thumb, and which way your thumb is facing. It can tell which muscles you're engaging at any given time, and how much — it knows the difference between a jab and an uppercut, and registers them differently. If you're playing with a friend, it can tell when the two of you switch places, or even when the two of you switch controllers. Kinect knows if you're smiling or frowning, or if you're talking or not. It knows if you're looking at the screen or not, and will only register your commands if you're looking. It knows, by either remarkable science or sorcery, your heart rate just by looking at your face.
Kinect knows when you're talking, flexing, or smiling
We spent a few minutes in a crowded room using a prototype of the new Kinect, and we left reeling. There's almost no latency, things are astonishingly accurate — the muscle sensors knew even the slightest shift in my posture, and try as I might I couldn't make it think I was smiling when I wasn't. We heard it discern commands from a noise-filled room, and track our movements in the dark when we couldn't see them ourselves. It was a fairly controlled situation, though, and we're curious to see how it holds up in the real world.
The real world applications are really the whole game here. Kinect's raw capability is absolutely remarkable, but how developers will build them into games remains to be seen. Could a boxing game know the difference in how hard I punch? Could it know how tired I am based on my heart rate, and knock me out more easily? Could a shooter recognize that I'm too relaxed, and ratchet up the intensity to get me back in?
More than anything, that's what we're excited to see about Kinect and the Xbox One: how the immense amount of data turns into a more fun, more immersive gameplay experience. But at least at first blush, the data part seems to have been pretty much solved.

By Ben Gilbert posted May 21st, 2013 at 2:00 PM 0
The engineers in Microsoft's windowless next-gen Xbox silicon lab are rattled. And understandably so. We're in their office, after all, and we have a mess of cameras in the one place you're not allowed to have cameras (or even cellphones). We're obviously outsiders on Microsoft's multi-building, security-heavy Mountain View campus, especially given our quartet of esteemed escorts: Todd Holmdahl, Ilan Spillinger, Nick Baker and Greg Williams. These four gentlemen are leading the charge on both Microsoft's next big thing and, perhaps more importantly, a major effort to internalize silicon architecture at the traditionally software-focused megacorp.
The skittish engineers aren't worried we'll film the mess of 24-inch LCD screens running video-compression tests, or the rows of desks with water hose stations used for temperature stress tests, or even the sea of circuit boards in various states of disrepair -- that's all standard for any Silicon Valley computer lab. It's really just a single chip that's causing concern: a custom-built Microsoft SoC that sits at the heart of the Xbox One . It's this SoC that has us in Mountain View, Calif. -- in Silicon Valley, literally down the road from Google -- a mere five days before Microsoft will unveil its next game console to the world. Over six hours last Friday, we learned not just about that SoC, but also how the company plans to utilize it in the new console. We spoke with its four lead hardware architects. We toured the labs where they are testing the silicon, and where the next-generation Kinect was born. What follows is more than a look behind the silicon that drives the next Xbox -- it's a deep dive into the changing approach Microsoft's taking to creating devices.
Where the Xbox was built: An inside look at Microsoft's play for the next generation of gaming

Hidden silicon in the valley
Considering there are large Microsoft logos emblazoned on both the buildings and signs at each entrance to the campus, the company's Mountain View location isn't exactly "hidden." What the people are doing inside, however, is one of the only secrets about the company's next-generation Xbox that hasn't leaked . It's at this location that Williams and Baker -- the Xbox silicon development general manager and Xbox architecture distinguished engineer, respectively -- drew up the silicon architecture for Microsoft's the Xbox One.
In the first Xbox, Intel and NVIDIA crafted the silicon. In the case of Xbox 360, it was more of a joint effort between Microsoft and ATI / IBM. Though Microsoft's still working with AMD to build out some of its chips this time around, it's also invested millions of dollars in building out verification facilities (among others) on-site in Mountain View and doubling the amount of in-house engineering dedicated to silicon. Holmdahl explains:
"In the consumer space, to control your destiny, you can't just rely on commodity components. You have to be able to make your own silicon. It helps with performance; it helps with the cost; it helps make your product smaller; it helps you create your own IP (always a good thing). I'll argue you're a lot more flexible -- you're not relying on somebody else's schedule; you make your own. So we're obviously heading that way. The stuff we've done over the last 13, 14 years is one example of that within Microsoft. And you're gonna see more and more of that, is my guess, as you go forward."
For now, silicon's a teensy component of Microsoft. Of the company's approximately 95,000 employees, the silicon team is around 200 people, or roughly 0.2 percent of the total workforce. Double that if you count the system engineers working on next-gen gaming hardware -- the console, Kinect and accessories -- and that's still nothing compared to most dedicated chipmakers. Intel employs over 100,000 people, for instance, while NVIDIA employs around 7,000.
However small, Mountain View's 200-person team has been working heads-down for the past several years to verify its silicon architecture and get it "first time right." That's not to say that the chip returns perfect from manufacturing, but that it doesn't run into any major issues -- of course, there's a small team within the larger group that's dedicated to debugging. As Xbox Hardware Group Lead Holmdahl points out, "One transistor can mess up your day really badly," setting the team back months to try and isolate the issue. Unlike software development, you can't quickly (or cheaply) iterate on silicon implementation. Worse, the equivalent of "debugging" is a guesswork process. "The fewer times you have to redo it, the faster you can put your product on the market," Holmdahl adds, with a nod to the business logic that also drives that need for "first time right."
"We booted the OS within days of getting the SoC back," Williams says; a good indicator their initial architecture design wasn't tremendously off. "I'm proud to say that, in our schedule, we didn't have any major showstoppers.
It's extremely hard. It's a matter of breaking it down. There are ways you can determine 'is the right thing happening as an input into the chip, or is it illegal?' And within the chip, there are ways we can instrument on this board and with the silicon to bring signals about to say, 'Well, within the chip, we think it's maybe between these two blocks,' and to try to get access into that signal. Of course, when you're highly integrated ... that's not as easy once you've actually built it. That's part of the art, essentially, of the process."
That "art" he's speaking to applies across the entire spectrum of console development. For every generation, console manufacturers play a guessing game with internal specs, software / storage-medium support and a variety of other factors, hoping that they've prepared enough to support both aggressive initial interest and long-term attention from consumers and game developers.
Powering the living room of the (near) future: 'Xbox On'
In-house silicon is at the core of what makes the Xbox One tick. It provides the structure that enables the console to run two operating systems at once for instant multitasking, and for the new Kinect to dish out much more information than before (to the tune of 2 Gbps). Most importantly, the five pieces of custom silicon spread across the console and its new camera peripheral helped the Mountain View team support their vision of an "always-on" console. Rather than use your hands to turn it on like a baby's toy , simply saying "Xbox On" will immediately wake the new Xbox.
"The box will pop on and come to your home page or wherever you were last. In order to do that in an efficient way, you have to architect all of that into the box up front. A lot of it is in the SoC," Holmdahl says. That SoC contains both the CPU and GPU, as well as embedded ESRAM; the first two components are based on an AMD design, and custom-built into an SoC with embedded ESRAM. That CPU is based on the Jaguar design from AMD, with eight cores and a 4MB L2 cache, while the GPU is of the D3D11.1 (with extensions) variety, Baker told us.
The console runs in multiple power states, which means it runs in a low-wattage setting when not in use. (Microsoft wouldn't give us specifics other than to say, "The system is designed for an SoC up to about 100W, but will vary on the scenario.")
"If you look at the instant app-switching, if you look at multiple OSes, if you look at power consumption -- that placed a lot of the main constraints on what we did on the silicon," Baker tells us. Some of the silicon design was derived from data center concepts, as that was the only parallel in computing available. "You're trying to make that technology seamless for the living room. It doesn't mean we need 64-bit CPU architecture. We're talking about many, many cores so you can run these tasks in parallel. We wanted to be able to support 8GB [of RAM] out of the chute, to probably support virtualization, which is what you need for running multiple operating systems. That's just a lot of making sure you have the right security systems in place so things don't stomp on each other."
In-house silicon also powers the other crucial component driving Microsoft's vision for the Xbox One: the new Kinect. Improved cameras and acoustics, not to mention a sleeker form factor, are all nice changes; it's discussing the new CMOS sensor's processor, however, that gets Spillinger, a passionate, intense gentleman (whose lovable accent sadly doesn't translate to text), visibly giddy.
"The highlight of the story is the CMOS sensor, which we developed internally," Spillinger says. "This design was done completely, 100 percent on this site. This is brand-new technology. There is discontinuity between this technology and the first Kinect; from the technology perspective that we are using for depth, for 3D measurement. So this was done here. On this one, this was a complete Microsoft custom design, where our engagement is directly with the manufacturer. It's not with any third party. We did the work. We do the qualification of the parts. We do the validation of the parts. We have done everything on this one."
If it isn't clear enough from that, he is a beaming father when it comes to the next generation of Kinect. And yes, you read that right -- your old Kinect won't work with the Xbox One.
Spillinger joined Microsoft just as the company was beginning work on the first Kinect (then "Project Natal"). He hailed from IBM, where he led the team that created the Xbox 360's CPU. At the time (early '08), he thought he was joining the Xbox hardware team to get started on a next-generation gaming console.
"First I was the design architect in Intel, then a design manager at IBM, and when I joined Microsoft, the view was 'Okay, it's about time -- early '08 -- to start to think about the next gen,'" he says. "It didn't take us five and a half years to get there, because what happened is that the moment sort of turned around and we started development of Kinect. The entire focus was about shipping Kinect, which now, if you in retrospect see, is such a great success."
The first Kinect did indeed sell very, very well for Microsoft -- 24 million as of this past February. Microsoft's decision to refocus on a new Kinect with much-improved audio recognition makes sense -- many users employ the first model solely as a HAL 9000-like order-taker. Beyond "improved acoustic models," Holmdahl says the new Kinect can track whoever is speaking using a "beam array" on the video side, which works with the audio side. It can identify, "exactly who is talking, and then be able to subtract out other people in the room so you get a really clear audio signal into your box." As time goes on, he promises that Microsoft will push out improvements to voice recognition and commands, and, "At some point, we'll be able to have conversational understanding."
If that isn't HAL, what is?
Inside the Silicon lab
Like so many other engineering labs, the one we're touring is pumped full of cool, conditioned air, very white and rife with LCD monitors. A visually demanding scene from The Avengers plays on loop, putting stress on various iterations of circuit boards, while very smart, very young engineers monitor nearby workstations flooded with code. A handful of monitors display a basic dolphin animation that Microsoft uses in-house -- if the dolphin's moving, you're in business (essentially). Another few are running a very pared-down version of an Xbox Dashboard, which looks similar to that of the 360 (or perhaps more apt, that of Windows 8's Live Tile arrangement) -- the system says "Hi" and seeks a user, which the engineer quickly skirts on the debug hardware using a wired Xbox 360 controller.
Black tubes protrude from the workstations, pumping hot and cold water into the lab for stress testing (and the occasional multimillion-dollar water fight, we imagine).
Black tubes protrude from the workstations, pumping hot and cold water into the lab for stress testing (and the occasional multimillion-dollar water fight, we imagine). CPU sockets sit unused, next to racks of circuit boards running the SoC through the virtual gauntlet. In one corner, a massive 4K television is seamlessly playing two HD video streams from a single box. Though the Xbox One is capable of pushing and receiving 4K signals, this test station is an illustration of how Microsoft's architecture went into the console's SoC (not a demonstration of its raw power). Spillinger said that the new console's ability to decode multiple HD streams at once is a measure of his team demanding specific silicon design from third-party partners.
"When we talk about the SoC and the general-purpose SoCs out there, this is per our requirement," Spillinger tells us while we huddle around the station. "This is our aggressiveness to have two HD streams being compressed, decompressed. It's actually a parallel circuit, it's not part of the CPU / GPU -- it's an add-on."
A tray full of the much-celebrated SoCs sits unceremoniously next to an electrical signal analyzer. "Definitely no photos of that one!" Williams half-jokes as he hands us a dead SoC to examine. This room and its many stations is the first of several we tour, and it's a good place to start, given what it symbolizes. The depth of hardware verification taking place in Mountain View is unprecedented for the software company, and offers further evidence of its internal silicon investment.
Making a fake video game console
Principal Design Verification Engineer Padma Parthasarathy has a bowl full of M&Ms on her desk, right next to the door, which she invites guests to indulge in. Next to that, her computer is running a software virtualization of a game console. And that's her job -- as "principal design verification engineer" -- to verify whether or not all the bits and pieces of the chips driving Microsoft's next Xbox are working as they should be. It's part of the ongoing process the company's set up to create its own silicon, and it's an important step. Without people like Parthasarathy, chip development could go from a few years to a decade or more. She is yet another fail-safe in the endless quest for "first time right."
In her little office, on a standard desktop computer, the logic behind the Xbox One is running -- from a server farm on campus -- through a variety of test scenarios. She can log issues on hardware that doesn't exist yet, essentially troubleshooting a game console being faked by software on a server farm (its components, anyway). Given the complex nature of the virtualization, tests can only be processed at a fraction of actual run speed, but it's still one of the best ways to troubleshoot hardware ahead of mass-producing millions of units.
Parthasarathy's time with Williams and others on the team goes all the way back to the 3DO. "She has been the architect of the verification team for all of these years," he tells us as we leave for another part of campus. She's been with Microsoft since 1998, when Microsoft absorbed her team (and Williams') in an acquisition. It's people like Parthasarathy that are helping bridge the gap between the company's old approach to gaming hardware and its future.
The next step in faking a game console requires a giant machine that needs its own HVAC system, of course. The spaceship-like device originates with Cadence Design Systems, and serves to run a variety of processor emulations. A peek into its innards reveals all sorts of hoses and wires, akin to opening a panel on a Willy Wonka candy machine; an even larger machine sits outside the building, powering its test conditions. Our friend the dolphin shows up once more on a monitor displaying what the emulator is up to, but his movement is imperceptible due to the speed of the emulation. Next up is a significantly smaller lab with what looks like a standalone meat locker. The meat locker has a manned workstation in front of it, where one very unlucky engineer spends his time logging issues registered by the consoles being tested within.
Before long, the four gentlemen who architected the Xbox One lock our video producer Ben Harrison in that meat locker -- which is actually a temperature chamber for running the console through a variety of thermal extremes. The chamber is full of hundreds of variations of prototype Xbox hardware -- today, it's set to very cold -- and is vital in determining how the Xbox One stands up to extreme thermal conditions. With laughs all around, he's freed from the icy, zebra-filled prison. Surprising no one, the various beta kits of the console itself, the controller and the new Kinect all sport zebra-pattern tape to hide their shape (as rumored). What wasn't known is that the zebra tape serves a purpose: it's used in product design specifically to hide angles from sneaking photographers, and is usually employed by the auto industry. The final version of the console looks damn similar (if not identical) in shape and design to the developer beta kits, and Microsoft is understandably leery of leaks. At this point, though, the cat's out of the bag.
The virtual console becomes reality
When Holmdahl lifts the dark cloth off a black, rectangular box, a gamepad and the new Kinect, it's the first time some of his own colleagues have seen the final designs. Not a beta kit with zebra tape, or a mockup, but a presentation-ready prototype. As we stand around the hardware placed on a little circular table, the concept of the box "slipping into the home entertainment center" is mentioned. The Xbox One is no "inhale" -- it looks like a little computer with a slot for discs. It's got a two-tone finish of alternating black matte and gloss, with a slot-loading Blu-ray disc drive and its power button greeting users out front. It's ... well, it's not such a looker. At least not thus far -- anything could change by the time it ships, though it seems doubtful the form factor will change dramatically.
When Holmdahl lifts the dark cloth off a black, rectangular box, a gamepad and the new Kinect, it's the first time some of his own colleagues have seen the final designs.
The gamepad, similar as it is to the 360's, is both smaller and chunkier all at once. Though it's designed to be sleeker all around -- shortened analog sticks, a shrunken battery pack area, a lack of screw holes -- we couldn't help but think it looked a bit rough around the edges. It has a distinct "mid-'90s vision of the future" look to it. And it's certainly not helping that the 360 gamepad is considered by many to be the best game controller ever built.
Kinect also got a visual makeover, and looks the nicest for the revisions. For starters, only one eye glares at you from the front, and the new chassis is a clean update to a clunky, aging peripheral. Unlike the Johnny Five-esque look of the original Kinect, the second version deserves the prime placement in living rooms that it demands.
The five
"In different levels, we were working on five custom-designed components. Silicon components. Three of them going to the console and two of them to the sensor," Spillinger explains. That's the SoC that drives the console, the CMOS processor in the new Kinect, I/O integrators in both Kinect and the console, and a digital signal processor on the Blu-ray drive. For the four gentlemen who show us around the Mountain View campus and scads of others we don't meet, getting to the point where so much of that silicon was designed and verified in-house is the fruition of years of work.
It's a major shift away from the company's past reliance on external partners, with only AMD serving as collaborator this time around. And like any game console launch, it's another huge investment for the next... five, eight, 10 years? That's an unknown, of course, but it seems likely based on history that we'll have the Xbox One for the foreseeable future. Whatever the future dictates, it looks like we'll see internally developed chips in many of Microsoft's products going forward.

Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., shown in 2011.
Several power utilities say they face a barrage of cyberattacks on their critical systems, a report by two Democratic lawmakers found, echoing warnings from the Obama administration that foreign hackers were trying to bring down the U.S. power grid.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released the report, co-authored with Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., at the House Energy and Commerce Committee's cybersecurity hearing on Tuesday.
The pair asked some 160 utilities to describe their experiences fighting cyberattacks over the past five years. In response, more than a dozen said they experienced daily, constant or frequent attempted cyber attacks, according to a 35-page report summarizing their responses.
But utilities termed the report as overblown, saying their systems were adequately protected through mandatory standards set by the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC) that ensure separation of control systems and consumer-facing or administrative networks.
"The majority of those attacks, while large in number, are the same attacks that every business receives" through Web-connected networks, Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation Chief Executive Duane Highley told the hearing.
"Those are very routine kinds of attacks and we know very well how to protect against those ... Our control systems are not vulnerable to attack," he told Reuters after the hearing, saying current NERC standards make it illegal to interconnect the public-facing networks and the control centers.
But many lawmakers echoed some senior White House officials in expressing fear that while they do not know of any successful attack on the power grid, hackers may have that ability.
Senior Obama administration officials began warning late last year that foreign enemies are looking to sabotage the U.S. power grid, air traffic control systems, financial institutions and other infrastructure.
Last week, NERC Chief Executive Officer Gerry Cauley told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit that there has never been a destructive cyber attack on the grid, mostly probes and spying malicious software and that he worried more about physical attacks on the power grid than cyber ones.
Tuesday's report cited an unidentified Northeastern power provider as saying it was under constant attack from cyber criminals as well as activist groups who have been targeting firms in the energy sector over the past few years.
A power provider from the Midwest said it experienced daily probes of its systems: "Much of this activity is automated and dynamic in nature, able to adapt to what is discovered during its probing process," the company said.
Markey is running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts against Republican Gabriel Gomez, seeking the seat vacated by John Kerry, now U.S. Secretary of State.
This year, the House has also passed a cybersecurity bill meant to ease the sharing of data between the government and the private sector, despite the threat of veto by President Barack Obama over privacy concerns. The Senate is working on its own version of the bill.
Highley welcomed the work toward an industry-led solution and better communication with the government, but pleaded with the legislators that "NERC has it covered. Please don't mess up."
"We're all about reliability. We don't want to have lights going out anymore than anybody else does," he told Reuters.

AI that won Jeopardy may save us from customer service hell.
by Jon Brodkin - May 21, 2013 3:09 pm UTC
Forbes
It's been more than two years since IBM's Watson kicked some human butt on Jeopardy , and now the artificial intelligence system is on the verge of making it onto smartphones. IBM today announced "Watson Engagement Advisor," software that lets businesses replace their current automated customer service systems with one that is based on Watson and is thus presumably much smarter.
Given the sorry state of automated customer service, it would be hard for Watson to make matters worse, and perhaps Watson will take away some of the pain of trying to talk to robots posing as customer service agents.
In the time since Watson wowed Alex Trebek, IBM's "research and development staff has made Watson 75 percent smaller, 25 percent faster, and have been working hard to improve Watson’s ability to answer consumer-oriented questions," IBM's GM of Watson Solutions Manoj Saxena wrote in a blog post today .
Consumers interacting with Watson would be able to either type inquiries or speak them, with voice-recognition technology provided by third-party vendors such as Nuance,  a New York Times story said . ANZ Bank in Australia and New Zealand told the Times that it's testing Watson Engagement Advisor and is confident that it will work well in real life.
Saxena continued:
Consumers will be able to experience this new level of personalized service through the brands they already have relationships with—their banks and investment advisors, their phone service providers, insurance companies, favorite stores and other trusted organizations. For instance, a bank might offer Watson directly to customers on websites and mobile devices to help give them insights regarding retirement and various types of savings instruments like 401k accounts. An individual may begin a dialogue with Watson on their smartphone, but continue later from where they left off on their PC or tablet. Alternatively, a telecommunications firm could equip their call center agents with Watson to assist customers in troubleshooting a problem with a product, service, or billing issue.
A  Forbes article states that Watson Engagement Advisor will be rolled out by several businesses within a few months. The "Ask Watson" feature will interact with customers via e-mail, smartphone apps, SMS, and online chats.
"Last year there were over 261 billion calls made on call centers, and one out of two calls went unresolved," Saxena said in a  video  IBM released yesterday. "We have a situation where customers are telling us more about themselves than they ever did. At the same time they are more frustrated that companies don't understand them."
Here's a look at that video:
IBM Watson hits customer service world.

All games for Microsoft's Xbox One must first be installed onto the console's HDD before they can be played, according to a report from Wired .
Wired reports that game discs must first be installed onto the Xbox One and, if owners want to use the disc with a second account, that owner would be given the option to pay a fee and install the game from the disc. This suggests that, once installed, games may no longer require their discs.
It is unclear whether this means Xbox One will support used games and what this means for users who rent games or lend them to friends.
Current-gen consoles like the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 support used games, which make up a significant portion of retail game sales.
While competitor Sony is yet to confirm whether the PlayStation 4 will support used games, its VP of Worldwide Studios, Michael Denny told CVG back in February that it would "do the right thing" by consumers, saying that Sony understands that it's a "massively important issue" and it would be considering the wants of both gamers and game makers.
Update: A Microsoft spokesperson tells Polygon that used games will indeed be supported by the Xbox One.
"Xbox One’s support for used games and these other scenarios may not look like they have on previous console generations, and that’s what we’ll be explaining as soon as we’re able," the spokesperson said.
According to an official Q&A, the Xbox One is being designed to "enable customers to trade in and resell games. We'll have more details to share later."
Update 2: One of Xbox's support Twitter accounts recently responded to concerns over the Wired report, stating that there were no fees associated with Xbox One's used game policy.
Update 3: Microsoft has dismissed earlier reports on used-game fees as " potential scenarios ."
@ modronfixer No fee, correct - and they just got that information wrong. As soon as we saw, we contacted them to correct it. ^EM

The Wired article has indeed been updated to mention that Microsoft will unveil its used game policy for the One in the future; however, it still references a fee required to transfer the game over to a second party. We're still waiting to hear the official policy from Microsoft, and will update this post if and when we get answers.

An Honor for the Creator of the GIF
By AMY O'LEARY
Among the thousands of file formats that exist in modern computing, the GIF, or Graphics Interchange Format, has attained celebrity status in a sea of lesser-known BMPs, RIPs, FIGs and MIFFs. It was honored as a “word of the year” in 2012, and Tuesday night, its inventor, Steve Wilhite, will be accepting a lifetime achievement award at The Webby Awards.
Now, almost any fragment of digital culture can be spun up into a grainy, gratifying animation. GIFs provide a platform for nearly everything, it seems — from rapid-fire political commentary to digital art to small moments of celebrity intrigue.
Has any file format received more attention, more accolades (or had more fun) than the GIF?
Invented in 1987, today the GIF has become the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture. Even Yahoo released one to announce the company’s acquisition of Tumblr this week, seen below.
“It’s been an incredibly enduring piece of technology,” said David-Michel Davies, the executive director of The Webby Awards. “Even as bandwidth has expanded,” he said, “it has been very exciting to see how much cultural cachet the format has gotten.”
But back in 1987, such things could not be imagined. Dial-up speeds were achingly slow. Image downloads were made even worse by interoperability problems. An article that year in the magazine, “Online Today” described the problem:
“Horror stories about incompatible microcomputers may be humorous when everyone is in a good mood, but they are certainly the nemesis of any serious computer user. The frustration is no laughing matter when a person wants to transfer some data or a graphics image, and the system doesn’t cooperate.”
Mr. Wilhite, then working at CompuServe (the nation’s first major online service) knew the company wanted to display things like color weather maps. Because he had an interest in compression technologies, Mr. Wilhite thought he could help.
Steve Wilhite was featured in an October 1987 issue of the CompuServe magazine, “Online Today” for inventing the GIF.
“I saw the format I wanted in my head and then I started programming,” he said in an e-mail. (He primarily uses e-mail to communicate now, after suffering a stroke in 2000.) The first image he created was a picture of an airplane.
The prototype took about a month and the format was released in June 1987.
“I remember when other people saw the GIF,” he said. Colleagues abandoned work on on other black and white formats, he said, as graphics experts began to spread the GIF online. A triumph of speed and compression, the GIF was able to move as fast as Internet culture itself, and has today become the ultimate meme-maker.
In the last decade, the animated GIF has reigned supreme, and while Mr. Wilhite has never himself made an animated GIF, he said the classic, “dancing baby” from 1996 remains a favorite.
Since retiring in 2001, Mr. Wilhite has led a quieter existence than his creation. He goes on RV trips. He built a house in the country with a lot of lawn to mow. He dabbles in color photography and Java programming. He uses e-mail and Facebook to keep up with family.
He is proud of the GIF, but remains annoyed that there is still any debate over the pronunciation of the format.
“The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations,” Mr. Wilhite said. “They are wrong. It is a soft ‘G,’ pronounced ‘jif.’ End of story.”
The webcast of Mr. Wilhite’s Webby Award acceptance speech will be on YouTube on Wednesday.

Scripps reporters uncover mishandling of customer data; companies threaten to sue.
by Sean Gallagher - May 21, 2013 9:15 pm UTC
72
TerraCom's website offers free cell phones to low income customers; its call center company gave customers' personal data away.
Call it security through absurdity: a pair of telecom firms have branded reporters for Scripps News as "hackers" after they discovered the personal data of over 170,000 customers —including social security numbers and other identifying data that could be used for identity theft—sitting on a publicly accessible server. While the reporters claim to have discovered the data with a simple Google search, the firms' lawyer claims they used "automated" means to gain access to the company's confidential data and that in doing so the reporters violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with their leet hacker skills.
The files were records of applicants for the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Lifeline subsidized cell phone program for low-income consumers. The applicants' information was collected for the telecom providers YourTel and TerraCom by Vcare, an India-based call center service contracted to verify applicants' eligibility. To qualify for the program, customers need to submit proof that they are enrolled in a federal or state assistance program such as Supplemental Security Income, food stamp programs, and the federally funded free school lunch program.
Vcare and the telecom providers are explicitly required to not retain this data under the regulations of the FCC program. However, the data was retained on Vcare's servers and posted to an open file-sharing area—and apparently indexed by Google's search engine in the process.
Scripps News' Isaac Wolf contacted the chief operating officer of TerraCom and YourTel for an interview. The two companies are separate legal entities but are substantially owned by the same people and, as the company's attorney put it, "share some key management employees." In an e-mail to TerraCom and YourTel COO Dale Schmick, Wolf informed Schmick that he had "stumbled across numerous Lifeline applications… which are posted freely online."
However, Vcare and the two telecom companies assert that the reporters "hacked" their way into the data using "automated" methods to access the data. And what was this malicious hacking tool that penetrated the security of Vcare's servers? In a letter sent to Scripps News by Jonathan D. Lee, counsel for both of the cell carriers, Lee said that Vcare's research had shown that the reporters were "using the 'Wget' program to search for and download the Companies' confidential data." GNU Wget is a free and open source tool used for batch downloads over HTTP and FTP. Lee claimed Vcare's investigation found the files were bulk-downloaded via two Scripps IP addresses.
Lee's letter demanded that Scripps immediately identify the "Scripps Hackers" and preserve any evidence of downloaded data, "as civil litigation is highly likely." He stressed that the companies' intent is to discover the extent of the breach and determine if the reporters were just accessing the data for journalistic reasons—in which case, they would not have to report the exposure as a data breach.

The Syrian Electronic Army: 9 Things We Know
If a cyber war breaks out, what's a CIO to do?
Prepare for cyber bombings? Get off the Internet and avoid the virtual front? Let the government step in and take over cyber defense for private networks? Hire Pinkerton-style paramilitaries to go out and crack cyber skulls?

These are some of the questions raised in a recent talk about cyber war and civil liberties given at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society by Timothy H. Edgar, the first White House director of privacy and civil liberties .
[ How can you avoid punching some granny in Akron whose PC is a zombie? Read 4 Steps For Proactive Cybersecurity . ]
Edgar told a crowded room that we are not in a cyber war, at least not now. But some would consider Stuxnet an act of war -- although the U.S. does not. And what company wouldn't want a little help staving off Anonymous ?
Timothy Edgar
"In some ways … we are in a September 10th moment," said Edgar. "The intelligence community is screaming that we have problems and we need to do something about it."
Edgar argued that as attacks from all sorts of sources have increased, the U.S. government is increasingly concerned with protecting computer networks, particularly those at companies involved with critical infrastructure. But security concerns must be balanced with expectations of privacy that are a basis of our democracy, and also with the need to maintain a competitive economy.
"How are we going to maintain a free Internet with personal privacy?" Edgar asked. "Will we destroy the Internet to try to save it?"
Rearchitecting the Internet to make it more secure would likely disrupt some of the things that have made the Internet popular and commercially useful.
He pointed out that although President Obama has said the government won't dictate security standards to private companies, and won't monitor private sector networks and Internet traffic, it is already doing so. "What I take this promise to mean is we will not have a comprehensive Internet monitoring program to use cyber security to do programmatic monitoring of all kinds," Edgar said.
CIOs can help themselves by adopting technologies such as private information retrieval, a cryptography technique that will let a company give limited access to records in its databases.
Edgar also says CIOs in firms considered part of the U.S.'s critical infrastructure need to expect that they will be asked, or possibly told, to adopt the Einstein intrusion detection system

"The pros would be a central command and control structure, access to the latest technology (ideally), and it's funded by the taxpayers rather than each company," said a cyber security special agent at the Department of Defense, who asked that his name not be used. CIOs would likely gain access to classified intelligence on geopolitical threats that could enrich understanding about certain markets. They would be less likely to run into international incidents, and if they chose to respond to an attack, they would have federal blessing.
The drawbacks, he said, could include 24/7 government attention, limited threat data sharing -- because the government doesn't need to share if it's doing the protecting -- more intimate knowledge of your specific corporate network, and the potential that the government might make mistakes that damage corporate bottom lines.
CIOs also should be aware of the http://www.nist.gov/itl/cyberframework.cfm">NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and be prepared to adopt its best practices recommendations, he said.
A CIO could argue that the government can't protect itself , so how will it protect the rest of us?
But does that mean CIOs should prepare to go on the offensive? In the physical world, it would be unthinkable. But Edgar says cyber law is a greyer area. The U.S. itself has declined to sign treaties that ban cyber weapons. And what would they ban? Social networks are seen by some governments as destabilizing forces.
Edgar thinks some companies could decide to go on the offensive in their own right, particularly multinationals, whose personnel outside the U.S. might be exempt from U.S. anti-hacking laws.
"A lot of companies aren't going to go there," he said. But he told InformationWeek that companies could certainly hire their own cyber-Pinkertons, who could have the freedom to try to take down cyber attackers.
Of course, doing so could land CIOs in the middle of an international incident, if they go after a cyber attacker that turns out to be part of a foreign government. The same holds true for CIOs overseas, who could find themselves engaged with U.S. cyber forces.
It's a complicated issue. CIOs need to know the terms of engagement.

Tuesday May 21, 2013 6:44 am PDT by Jordan Golson
After jostling in competing memoranda yesterday, Apple and a group of U.S. Senators are prepared to go head-to-head in a committee hearing examining the tax avoidance strategies of Apple and other multinational corporations.
CEO Tim Cook, CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and Apple's head of tax operations Phillip A. Bullock will appear in front of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation in the second part of a committee hearing running now.
The hearing is streaming live on the subcommittee's website and below. We will be liveblogging the hearing at the bottom of this post.
Update: iOS users can view the hearing at NBCNews .
Apple yesterday released a statement laying out some of its international operations and financial strategies, noting that it paid $6 billion in federal income tax in 2012 and that it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States.
A bipartisan group of Senators responded with a statement of its own , accusing Apple of using several offshore subsidiaries to avoid paying income taxes. Said Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), "Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere."
Earlier today, the Irish government -- where a number of Apple's subsidiaries are headquartered -- said that it was not responsible for the tax rates Apple pays in other countries and that its system was transparent.
Liveblog- Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation, is reading a prepared statement accusing Apple of evading billions of dollars in taxes through subsidiaries in Ireland and elsewhere. Senator Levin noted that he is an iPhone owner.
- Levin says domestic companies that are not in a position to offshore their tax burden are at a competitive disadvantage. He accuses Apple of being partially responsible for the sequester and other budget cuts because of its tax avoidance strategies.
- He says Congress should close the tax loopholes that companies like Apple use, even if they don't pass a rework of the overall corporate tax system.
- Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is now giving an opening statement. "It's important all of us make it very clear the admiration we hold for Apple." However, the company is taking advantage of a system that allows profits to be shifted and allows the company to avoid paying taxes on $44 billion in income over the past 6 years. "It's completely outrageous that Apple has avoided paying US taxes and indeed avoided paying taxes around the world with its convoluted and pernicious strategies."
- McCain: American companies cannot continue avoiding paying taxes. "Our military can not afford it, our economy can not endure it, and the American people will not tolerate it." Our tax system is broken but that is not an excuse.
- Rand Paul (R-KY) is up and saying he is "offended" by the hearing. "Tell me a politician who is up here and doesn't try to minimize his taxes… Tell me what Apple has done is illegal. I am offended by a government… that convenes a hearing to bully one of America's greatest success stories… If anyone should be on trial here, it should be Congress. I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple."
- Instead of Apple executives, we should have brought in a giant mirror. This problem is solely and completely caused by our tax code. This committee should look in the mirror. "I find it abominable."
- Paul: I have a bill that would tax repatriated money at 5% and target that money to infrastructure. We need to apologize to Apple, compliment them for the job creation they're doing, and get on with our job and redo the tax code.
- Senator Levin is angry and fired up: Senator Paul, you can apologize if you wish but that isn't what this hearing is about. No company should be able to determine how much tax to pay and use gimmicks to pay lower taxes in this country. This subcommittee is not going to apologize to Apple. We did not drag them, they have come here willingly. We intend to hear from them and some experts.
- Tax experts from Harvard and Villanova are the first two witnesses in the hearing. Apple's executives will be the next group of witnesses.
- Professor Richard Harvey - Villanova: After reviewing their structure, I suspect… that what Apple has done is within the bounds of what is acceptable under International tax law. … However, the statement that Apple made "Apple does not use tax gimmicks…", I nearly fell off my chair when I read that. The bottom line is that Apple had a substantial amount of income recorded in Ireland and they paid essentially no tax.
- Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) - "Who benefits from Apple's tax strategy?" Professor Harvey: The shareholders. Johnson goes on to say that corporate tax rates should be eliminated entirely and corporate income should be taxed at the shareholder level.
- Senator Paul - "Neither this panel nor anyone on the committee has said Apple has broken any laws… it would probably be malpractice for them not to do so… I don't know of anybody on this panel who tries to maximize their tax burden. Mr. Harvey, do you take any deductions on your taxes?" "No." "Do you think you're a bad person for doing that?" "Absolutely not."
- Paul - "Money goes where it's welcome… we have a 35% corporate income tax, we're chasing people away from us… we should be giving them an award today." They are obeying the law. They are doing what their shareholders have asked, which is to maximize profit. Let's not vilify American companies.
- Levin - We are trying to shine a spotlight on big companies, we are not trying to vilify them. To call this vilification misses the function of the subcommittee and misses the function of Congress. We are here to look at the functions of Government and see how they work and don't.
- Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) - I'm very proud of Apple as an American company. I use Apple products and I harangued my husband until he switched. I think Apple is utilizing the tax code we have given them.
CEO Tim Cook, CFO Peter Oppenheimer and Apple's head of tax operations Phillip A. Bullock are now appearing in front of the Senate panel.
- Cook: "I am proud to represent Apple today… I am often asked if Apple still is an American company… My answer is an emphatic yes… Much of our innovation takes place in one zip code… Cupertino, California…"
- "We estimate 300,000 jobs have been created in the U.S. because of the App Store." We've chosen to keep the design and development of our revolutionary products right here. Over the last decade, our workforce grew by fivefold. We have employees in all fifty states. Apple has created hundreds of thousands of jobs at small and large businesses that support us.
- iPhone components are made in Texas and Kentucky. Apple is responsible for creating or supporting 600,000 new jobs. We've invested billions in the U.S. to create even more American jobs. We're investing $100 million jobs to create a line of Macs in the U.S. later this year. This will be assembled in Texas, and rely on equipment and supplies from other states.
- We've invested a huge new data center in North Carolina, building more in Oregon and Nevada, a new campus in Texas and a brand new headquarters in Cupertino.
- Apple has 'real' operations, in 'real' places, with Apple employees selling real products to real customers. We not only comply with the laws but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell products back on the U.S. Our foreign subsidiaries pull 70% of our cash because of the rapid growth of our international business. We use this money to finance construction of Apple retail stores around the world and fund production of products. It would be very expensive to bring that cash back to the United States. Unfortunately the tax code has not kept up with the digital age. We are handicapped in relation to our foreign competitors who do not have such constraints on the free movement of capital.
- We are a company of strong values. We believe our extraordinary success brings increased responsibilities to the communities where we live, build and sell our products. We believe in President Kennedy's phrase 'to whom much is given, much is required.' Apple is a champion of human rights, education and the environment. Our belief that innovation should serve humanity's deepest values and highest aspirations is not going to change.
- Apple has always believed in the simple, not the complex. You can see this in our products and in the way we conduct ourselves. It is in this spirit that we recommend a dramatic simplification of the corporate tax code. We make this recommendation with our eyes wide open, fully recognizing that this would likely result in an increase in Apple's U.S. taxes. We strongly believe that such reform would be fair to all taxpayers and would keep the U.S. competitive.
- Peter Oppenheimer: In the U.S., our operational structure is quite simple. We sell and support products through our retail stores and partners. Outside the U.S., we strive to provide the same sales in support as our customer expect in the U.S. Apple's presence in outside countries often takes the form of Apple-owned subsidiaries. These acquire products from other Apple subsidiaries which in turn buy product from Apple contract manufacturers.
- We are in full compliance with all laws and regulations. Virtually all of our R&D and the jobs that go with it, take place in the U.S. Apple and Apple Ireland use a cost-sharing R&D agreement to fund research. In return, Apple Ireland receives rights to sell products in Europe and Asia.
- For many years, our Irish subsidies have had thousands of employees in Ireland. The fact that our subsidiary does not pay taxes in Ireland does not affect our U.S. tax payments.
Cook/Oppenheimer/Bullock Q&A Beginning
- Subcommittee Chairman Levin quotes President Kennedy. Cook: President Kennedy and his brother are longtime heroes of mine. I don't believe deferral of tax payments is a sham in any way.
- Bullock in response to a question: Apple legally owns a number of subsidiaries in Ireland and overseas. It is "functionally managed and controlled" (an Irish legal term) in the United States. Our conclusions of Irish law addresses tax management and control if it takes place somewhere else. If it is managed and controlled in the U.S., we are not responsible for Irish taxes. Applying the Irish legal standard of central management and control, our Irish subsidiaries are managed in the U.S. 'Central management and control' is not a term under U.S. tax law.
- Cook: We have a significant number of employees in Ireland, but some of our most strategic decisions are made in the United States. They are functionally and practically managed in the United States.
- Bullock: U.S. taxes are paid by Apple, Inc. Cash that is distributed from our operating subsidiaries that come to the U.S., largely in terms of interest, is paid by Apple. The income of Apple subsidiaries is subject to tax in the local countries in which they operate. There is no U.S. tax on the transfer of balances from subsidiaries to other subsidiaries. Our companies pay the appropriate taxes in Ireland as per our agreement with the Irish government.
- Bullock: AOI has not filed an corporate income tax return on revenue earned overseas. Apple Inc. pays U.S. income tax on revenue it receives as a passthrough. AOI and AOE (Apple subsidiaries) own intellectual property rights to Apple IP overseas.
- John McCain questioning now. Calls Tim Cook a "tough guy". "Do you feel that you've been bullied or harassed by this committee or its members?" Cook: "I feel very good to be participating in the process. I would like for comprehensive tax reform to be passed this year. Any way that Apple can help, we're here to help." I feel that it's important for us to tell our story. I want people to hear that from me. I didn't get dragged here, sir.
- McCain: You have obviously, legally, taken advantage of the tax code both foreign and domestic. I think we agree that you are not paying the 35% tax rate that domestic companies are paying. Are you and Apple receiving an unfair advantage compared to domestic companies?
Cook: No, that's not the way I see it. Apple pays 30.5% of its profits in taxes in the United States. I don't know exactly where this stacks up relative to other companies. I think it stacks high on the list. I believe we are the top taxpayer in the United States. We do have a low tax rate outside the United States. This tax rate is for products we sell outside the United States. There's no shifting going on that I see at all.
McCain: Why does AOI exist? Why does AOI exist in Ireland?
Cook: AOI was created in 1980. The relationship between Apple and the Irish government still exists today. We've built up a significant skill base there of people who have a significant understanding of the European market. AOI is nothing more than a holding company. A holding company is a concept that many companies use. It's not an operating company. The dividends that go into this company have already been taxed appropriately in their local jurisdictions. AOI to me is nothing more than a company that has been set up to provide an efficient way to manage Apple's cash. From income that's already been taxed. The investment income that comes out of AOI is taxed in the United States at the full 35% rate. AOI does not reduce our US taxes at all.
McCain: Where is AOI, ASI and AOE a tax resident?
Cook: It is my understand that there is no tax resident for any of the three subsidiaries.
McCain: Does that sound logical?
Cook: ASI and AOE are paying Irish taxes. I personally don't understand the difference between a tax presence and a tax residence but I know they fill out and pay Irish taxes. AOI, because it's a holding company, it only makes investment income. All of that investment income is taxed in the US at the full 35% level.
McCain: If you look at the 35% tax burden, that I'm sure we're in agreement is way too high, you said the purpose of AOI is to ease administrative burdens. Isn't it obvious that you are not bearing the same tax burden as if you were bearing in the United States? This gives you some advantage over smaller companies located strictly in the US?
Cook: Sir, I have tremendous respect for you. I see this differently from you. Apple is earning these profits outside the US. By law and regulation, these are not taxable in the US. AOI invests that money overseas and then the interest from those investments is taxed in the US. I see this as a very complex topic and I'm glad we're having the discussion. Honestly, I don't see it as being unfair. I am not an unfair person. That's now who we are as a company and who I am as an individual. I do not see it that way.
McCain: I'm out of time, but why the hell do I have to keep updating the apps on my iPhone? Why can't you fix that?
Cook: We're looking to do better all the time.
- The panel is breaking for a short recess.
Senator McCaskill: If you don't tax plan, then you're incompetent as an American business. I hope I can understand better why the structure you've used has been embraced. You borrowed $17 billion, issued bonds to pay dividends to your shareholders. It was in the economic news because of your large cash reserves. You made a decision that it would be cheaper for you to service that debt and use the cash to pay dividends than to bring this cash back. Do you have the analysis that would show how much cheaper it would be than bringing the cash back?
Cook: The cost of capital is at an all-time low. Our weighted average cost of the borrowing was less than 2%. We were faced with a decision to go that route or pay 35% to repatriate. As we looked at that analysis, we felt strongly that in the best interests of our shareholders to secure the debt.
McCaskill: You negotiated a 2% interest rate with Ireland.
Cook: In part of recruiting Apple in 1980, we made an agreement with the country. They were trying to attract new tech companies. The skills of our 4,000 employees there are essential to servicing the European market. We have quite a strong presence there.
McCaskill: If Ireland recruited you and gave you a very good deal, how do we set tax policy? 3/4ths of net tech mobile growth will be in emerging markets? Do you agree with that?
Cook: A significant amount of growth will be in emerging markets.
McCaskill: If we simplify our tax code and get it down and clear out the underbrush, what keeps another country in these emerging markets from undercutting us like Ireland did?
Cook: The US has such enormous advantages and the barrier right now in terms of repatriating cash is that its at the 35% level. Our proposal is that we eliminate all corporate tax expenditures -- get to a very simple system and have a reasonable tax on bringing money back. Not 0%. I think if we did that, many companies would bring back capitol to invest in the US and it would be great in the United States.
McCaskill: What would it cost to move out of California or move entirely to Ireland or China? What keeps you from moving on a cost analysis basis?
Cook: We're an American company. We're proud to be an American company. The vast amount of our R&D is in California. We love it there.
McCaskill: It's an intangible?
Cook: It's who we are as people. We're an American company whether we're selling in China or Egypt. We're an American company. It has never entered my mind that we would move to another country. It's beyond my imagination and I have a wild imagination. It's beyond it.
McCaskill: On the bonds, I understand the business rationale. Do you think you should be able to deduct the interest on those? Would that be one of the corporate expenditures we do away with?
Cook: It could be. The way the tax code is written currently, my understand is that it would be deductible. It would be a very very small percentage of the overall tax rate we pay.
McCaskill: You decide where to allocate sale proceeds. Some of that is being made based on where the product is sold, but not all. How do you determine that? How much goes to the American company and how much goes to the International companies.
Cook: Everything we sell in the US is taxed in the US. For a foreign country, generally speaking, it is taxed in the local market and then if its one of the countries that are being served from Ireland, those units are generally sold by an Irish subsidiary. That income is taxed to the degree it needs to be in the local jurisdiction and then the proceeds go to an Irish subsidiary in many cases called AOI. This acts as a holding company and invests Apple's earnings. Then we pay taxes on those earnings in the United States.
McCaskill: Do any of the proceeds from my purchases actually get parked in Ireland under the aegis of intellectual property?
Bullock: No. 100% of the proceeds on any sale from a customer in the US is fully taxed in the US. There is no outbound payments going offshore.
Senator Johnson: This is complex. It has to do with how do you allocate income? What kind of transfer price is an appropriate price? I did notice that your US sales is 39% and 35% of income and international sales of 61% and 35% of income. Can you explain this?
Cook: Generally, Apple's Macintosh business is a larger percentage of its sales in the US than internationally. As we launch the iPhone, iPhone became a larger percentage of its business internationally than in the US because we had a nice base of Mac sales in the US.
iPhone has larger gross margin than Mac business. International business carries higher margins than US business.
Johnson: More profitable product mix outside the US than in the US?
Cook: Yes.
Johnson: You get a deduction for foreign taxes paid, right?
Bullock: It's a dollar for dollar credit.
Johnson: Now Apple has a lot more money and if you repatriate it, you'll tax it a lot more. The US would be a beneficiary if we can get more money repatriated?
Bullock: Yes, if its taxed and repatriated.
Johnson: Do you have IRS employees at your company full time basically? Being audited constantly?
Bullock: We are constantly under audit in many jurisdictions around the world and they are constantly looking at our numbers.
Johnson: Can you describe your shareholders in general?
Cook: Generally, Apple is widely owned because it is part of the indexes in the stock market. Across mutual funds and pension funds.
Oppenheimer: Our top 50 shareholders own half the company. Public employee retirement systems, mutual funds like Fidelity or Black Rock, and individual retail shareholders as well.
Johnson: Even the top 50 have wide fund shareholder bases. So those folks benefit that Apple can retain more of its profits by not paying taxes to foreign governments. What other taxes does Apple generate? What can you take credit for?
Oppenheimer: We paid $325m in federal employment taxes, in addition to our employees. We've paid $100 million to state and local governments in property taxes and other fees. Last year, we collected and remitted $1.3 billion in sales tax.
Johnson: $2 billion in total. When we talk about transfer pricing, we face the same dilemma between states, don't you? Between which state claiming what income?
Bullock: The income that the company generates in the US, the company generates 40% more or less, that income does get apportioned between the states amongst a slightly different system.
Johnson: What is the difference between that and allocating between different countries?
Bullock: Some states apportion based on relative sales. Some states use a multi factor test, may look to sales, property and payroll.
Johnson: Do you negotiate between the states? Do you have more of your income allocated to pay state income tax?
Bullock: It is approximately 100%. It is not double taxed.
Johnson: But that's a similar type of problem to allocating income across multiple countries, right?
Bullock: Similar, yes.
Johnson: Talk about how you pay taxes in other countries.
Bullock: In Fiscal 2012, the company paid a little over $900 million in international income taxes. We're projecting that number to be larger this year. That number is significantly larger than a few years ago. I don't have the statistics available but similar to the US there are employer contributions to payroll tax, and considerable amount of VAT and GST that is connected and remitted to various countries.
Johnson: What of your employment is based in the US and overseas?
Oppenheimer: 2/3rds of employment is in the US. Partially because of our retail stores.
Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH): The issue of the $102 billion that is present overseas, regarding repatriation. You'd be willing to pay some rate on repatriation. As we look on tax reform, what do you think is the rate, not just for Apple but for multinational corporations around the world, if we simplify the code, what rate should we be at to be competitive?
Cook: The rate on the US sales in my judgement from most of the studies would indicate it would need to be in the mid 20's. To incentivize a huge number of companies to repatriate, it would need to be in the single digits. Some companies would need to pay a bit more, other companies would pay less. More important than all of that, it would be great for growth in this country. That's why I am so adamant about doing this.
Ayotte: You're building a new data center here, you can't use overseas cash for that, right?
Cook: Yes, we can't use our overseas cash to make any investments in the U.S.
Ayotte: If you were in our position, how important is it that we change the tax code to make this a good place for investment? What would you do? You're not the only corporation that has significant monies overseas right now.
Cook: It's vital to do, it's great for America to do. We would have a much stronger economy if we did that. It would create jobs and investment.
Ayotte: If we create more jobs and investment, that means more taxes too, right?
Cook: That's a very excellent point. All ships rise with the tide.
Ayotte: What about an issue of a territorial rate? Hopefully we will reform the code to create a better dynamic for investment, but what about a territorial rate?
Cook: The US is advantaged if more capital moves into the country. It would strengthen our economy. I don't propose zero, but a reasonable tax on doing so. Some people refer to that as territorial and hybrid. That's how I believe it should work. We don't support a temporary tax holiday. We want comprehensive reform for a long time.
Ayotte: If we create a temporary tax holiday, does that encourage long term investment?
Cook: A permanent change is better because its predictable.
Ayotte: You talked about the advantages of being in this country. One is the IP protections in the US. You have faced significant challenges in China. What would be those challenges and thinking about IP protections in the US, how would we address this with our international partners?
Cook: We've faced more significant areas in other countries than China.
Ayotte: I've heard stories about knock off Apple Stores in China.
Cook: That has clearly been an issue. I think that the US court system is currently structured in such a way that its very difficult to get the protection a tech company needs because our cycles are very fast. The court system is very long, and the foreign competitors in the US can quickly take IP and use it and ship products with it and they're on to the next product as well. I would love to see conversations between countries and see protections between IP globally. For us, our intellectual property is so important, I would love the system to be strengthened in order to protect it.
Senator Rob Portman (R-OH): If we don't reform the tax code, we're competing with one hand tied behind our back. Almost all of our industrial competitors have shifted to a territorial system including the UK, France, Germany, Japan. I think that's the right way to go. They don't tax active business income earned beyond their borders and their businesses are more competitive as a result. $1.5-$2 trillion is locked up overseas. That money is being deployed to put factories and R&D overseas. We've got to move quickly. No other nation erects such a high barrier to bringing earnings back to the US. Every one of our global competitors have reformed their tax systems since we last reformed ours. Not just the rate, but the code. If we don't reform, we'll continue to lose opportunities. We need to create competitiveness so we can get new customers overseas. Tightening rules related to IP income is important too.
65% of your revenue is overseas. Is that accurate?
Cook: 2/3rds last quarter was overseas.
Portman: How many jobs in the US are because of overseas sales?
Cook: 600,000 jobs in the US total, it's difficult to allocate those to international. Our earnings overseas have powered our company.
Portman: We want you to sell stuff overseas because it causes jobs to come here. Is Samsung one of your major competitors? Is that an American company?
Cook: Yes, they are headquartered in South Korea.
Portman is comparing the Apple and Samsung's tax rates. Bullock says those rates are accurate, but Apple and Samsung pay similar global tax rates. However, Samsung can move their funds around the world as necessary and Apple cannot.
Portman: As a result, your investment rates are more limited than Samsung. How much do you spend on tax compliance efforts?
Bullock: I don't have that but it's a lot.
Portman: You should find out. I think the Americans want to know. I am a recovering lawyer, but I think you'd do better to spend money on engineers instead of lawyers. How big is your tax department?
Bullock: Several dozen around the world, plus several dozen more in support centers.
Portman: Plus a lot of law firms and outside help as well.
Bullock: If you can encourage Peter to hire me more people, that would be helpful as well.
Oppenheimer: The tax return that I sign each year is two feet tall or greater and we are under continuous examination and much of the effort particularly with our outside advisors is related to our US tax return.
Portman: So you have high tax compliance costs and you can't invest where you want to. What would happen if we just forced you to bring money back and take a chunk of that repatriated?
Cook: Very bad, sir. Not good.
Portman: I appreciate the hearing today, we don't want to design the tax code to require you to spend too much on tax compliance. We want a level playing field, it's a needlessly complex tax system, the solution isn't to tinker with the numbers or go backwards. We should take the President up on his offer to do comprehensive corporate tax reform. I hope this hearing helps us move towards that goal.
Levin: Of course you can bring the profits home. You bring them home from South America, right?
Cook: I don't understand the question. The economic transfer for Europe is in Ireland. For South America, I would guess there is some cash in South America.
Bullock: Profits from the rest of the Americas, including Mexico and Canada and Brazil is generated by Apple, Inc.
Chairman Levin is pushing back on Bullock and Oppenheimer over the Irish subsidiaries and the cost-sharing agreement they have. Cook and Oppenheimer both say they "disagree with the characterization" of the agreement.
Levin: Of course you can bring your profits home, $100 billion is stashed away in these three Irish companies that you control but its in their legal name. Will you bring those profits home? You can bring them home, you just have to pay the tax on it. You said you wouldn't bring that money home unless we reduce those tax rates.
Cook: There's a lot there. I'd appreciate the opportunity to answer that.
Levin: Is it true that you said you would not bring that money home at those tax rates?
Cook: I don't recall saying that. I have no plans to bring those funds back.
Levin: Isn't that you saying you would not bring the money back at the current tax rates?
Cook: I have no current plans to bring those funds back at the current rates.
Levin: You have an agreement that shifts the economic rights to the most valuable thing you have to three Irish companies. That's the shift. You're selling the golden goose. You have a right to do that, just like you have a right to not shift your intellectual property from Canada, Brazil and Mexico. OK, here's where we're at. You've got profits going, $100 billion, to Ireland. You say it's your current intent to not pay your taxes on it. You say you don't need to pay taxes on them. The economic value has been shifted.
Oppenheimer: We don't agree with your characterization.
Levin: What was shifted to them? In that agreement?
Oppenheimer: It began in 1980.
Levin: I'm talking about 2009.
Oppenheimer: We have not changed things since 1980. There is important context to the agreement that started 30 years ago.
Levin: There is an agreement in 2009. Apple employees signed that in 2008. It shifted economic rights to three Irish companies under your control that don't pay taxes in the United States.
Oppenheimer: I disagree with that.
Levin: It didn't shift the economic rights?
Oppenheimer: It started in 1980 --
Levin: You talked about that. I'm talking about the 2009 agreements. Did it give any rights to those Irish companies?
Oppenheimer: It's a continuation of an existing agreement.
Levin: It continued a transfer, under Apple's control, there is an agreement that is reached with a controlled corporation. You folks agreed you controlled it. Under that agreement, which continues an ongoing agreement -- you didn't have to shift your economic property, you're in control, it's your company. You made a decision. Don't kid ourselves as to the implications as to America's revenue. I'm not saying its illegal, I'm not saying its illegal. You made a decision to shift your crown jewels that creates the profits. You made that decision to continue that arrangement in 2008 and 2009.
Oppenheimer: We went to Ireland in 1980. We've continued to do that for the last 30 years. Our systems are set up for that way, our operations are. That's why we do that today.
Levin: The result of continuing that in 2008 is that most of your profits are stored in Ireland and are not taxed.
Oppenheimer: People love the iPhone and iPad around the world.
Levin: That's not the question, people love it everywhere. But the people who live it in Canada and Mexico and Brazil, their purchases are taxed here. Not in Europe. Most of your profits which come from your brilliant intellectual property, the continuation of that system, means that most of your profits are sitting in three Irish companies that you control that don't pay taxes. That's the result. You can defend it, but that's the result. Folks, there's a huge drain as a result. You point out, Mr. Cook, that 95% of the creativity that goes into those products is in California. Two-thirds of those profits are in Ireland. You've made a decision not to bring that money home.
Cook: We're proud that that R&D is in the US. All of the profits in the United States are taxed in the United States.
Levin: I know that. And all the profits from Mexico and Canada and Argentina are taxed in the United States. But you made a decision to shift economic value overseas and the result is that most of your profits are not taxed. You're an American company. You're proud of it, we're proud of it. The result of these arrangements is that most of your profit is now in Ireland in these companies that don't exist. Of course we have to change this system. But to change it, we have to understand what is going on. What is going on is a huge loss of revenue to the United States. We've got these corporations that are able to shift profits to places where you don't pay income tax on it. We better understand that if we're going to correct it. That's our purpose here today. To shed a light on that. I hope that purpose has been achieved. We cannot continue a system where the company, a multinational company, is phenomenally as successful as yours and can make a decision, sitting down in 2008 as to where the profits will flow.
Where the R&D is 95% in the United States. You got R&D tax credits, all the benefits of living in this country. You're sitting there, unilaterally deciding whether to continue a system where profits are shifted to a place where they are not available to the American taxman. Everyone agrees that we need to change this system. In order for us to change this system, we've got to understand what is going on. You make a unilateral decision, three Apple employees in 2008, essentially decided where these profits will be taxed or not taxed. It's not right. That is not right. To leave that decision, it seems to me, the way it is decided so unilaterally, that a company can shift its value to a tax haven -- that's what Ireland is -- I know its your intention and I applaud your view. I know its not even to come in front of the spotlight. It's important for us to write the laws. You agreed Mr. Cook that we need to rewrite these laws. Thank you for coming.
Messrs. Cook, Oppenheimer and Bullock have now been excused.

A book Untangling the Web: A Guide to Internet Research (PDF) produced by the The National Security Agency to uncover intelligence hiding on the web has just been released by the NSA, following a FOIA request, Wired reports .
It offers advice for using search engines, the Internet Archive, and other online tools. But the most interesting is the chapter titled “Google Hacking.” For example: to find spreadsheets full of passwords in Russia? Type “filetype:xls site:ru login.” Even on websites written in non-English languages the terms “login,” “userid,” and “password” are generally written in English, the authors helpfully point out.
Misconfigured web servers “that list the contents of directories not intended to be on the web often offer a rich load of information to Google hackers,” the authors write, then offer a command to exploit these vulnerabilities — intitle: “index of” site:kr password.
Johnny Long has been talking about this for years at hacker conferences and in his book Google Hacking , Wired notes.

Individual games will be tied to Xbox Live accounts, Microsoft said, meaning that the software giant can detect whether a game has been sold to a retailer and repurchased, or handed from one friend to another. In such instances, the second user must pay a fee.
"On the new Xbox, all game discs are installed to the HDD to play," a Microsoft representative told Wired .
The company added that, once discs are installed on the hard drive, games can be played without a disc being in the tray.
The Wired article then elaborates: "What follows naturally from this is that each disc would have to be tied to a unique Xbox Live account, else you could take a single disc and pass it between everyone you know and copy the game over and over. Since this is clearly not going to happen, each disc must then only install for a single owner."
It added: "Microsoft did say that if a disc was used with a second account, that owner would be given the option to pay a fee and install the game from the disc, which would then mean that the new account would also own the game and could play it without the disc."
Microsoft did not disclose what the second-user fee would amount too, and did not clarify further on the matter.
The article claims that there is no sweeping 'always-online' requirement for future Xbox One games.
Update: Jon Hicks, the editor of Official Xbox magazine, has claimed that pre-owned games will be un-installed from the previous owner's system and installed onto another's. It is not clear if this process would negate a pre-owned fee.
On second hand games: you buy disc, it installs, you play from HD. Sell disc, it installs to new console and deactivates your install.— Jon Hicks (@MrJonty) May 21, 2013
Update 2: Microsoft has neither confirmed nor denied the report in a statement offered to Venturebeat.
"We are designing the Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games," a Microsoft spokesperson said , adding: "We'll have more details to share later".
The comment effectively means that the claim regarding a pre-owned fee is not inaccurate.
Update 3:Microsoft corporate vice president Phil Harrison has suggested that customers who activate a pre-owned retail disc for the Xbox One will need to pay the same price as the original buyer to access the content.
When asked by Kotaku whether the secondhand owner will be "paying the same price we [the original buyer] paid, or less" Harrison responded "let's assume it's a new game, so the answer is yes, it will be the same price."
Harrison also said that owners can trade their secondhand games online, however the company is "not talking about it today".
Update 4: Microsoft's Larry Hryb has clarified statements regarding using owned Xbox One titles on separate devices:
"Another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend's house - should you choose to play your game at your friend's house, there is no fee to play that game while you are signed in to your profile."

It's clever enough to beat humans on quiz shows and diagnose illnesses, but is IBM's artificially intelligent supercomputer tough enough to cope with angry consumers who've been on hold for three hours?
IBM certainly seems to think so, as it has just given Watson a new job as a customer service manager.
Rather than phoning a company and having your query dealt with by the usual call centre cast of teenagers, simpletons and ex-convicts, you can call Watson, who will deal with your increasingly angry enquiries with all the calmness you'd expect from a machine.
The new service will be called the Watson Engagement Advisor and will allow customers to ask questions using real language, either on the phone or through webpages, email or instant messaging.
According to IBM, their customer service-focused equivalent of Skynet will "quickly address customers' questions, offer advice to guide their purchase decisions, and troubleshoot their problems" - something few call centre workers find themselves doing very effectively.
For anyone annoyed by the thought of speaking to a robot when they need to take out a loan or query a gas bill, it may come as some relief to hear that Watson is actually cleverer than a human being.
It beat two Jeopardy champions during a special version of the show, diagnoses illnesses and even got a job on Wall Street .
In a blog post, Manoj Saxena, general manager of IBM Watson Solutions, said the system would revolutionise the way we interact with businesses:
We’re widening the scope that the technology addresses. It’s gratifying and exciting to see how rapidly this technology is developing. And, as far as I’m concerned, this is just the start. This next era of computing is going to touch all of our lives in positive ways we can’t yet imagine.
The new era of customer service will work via an "Ask Watson" feature, which will be able to answer questions from ordinary people and then offer solutions.
IBM has managed to shrink the system by 75 per cent while making it 25 per cent faster, meaning cell centres will get a lot of bang for their buck as they begin to fire their human staff.
Saxena continued:
Consumers will be able to experience this new level of personalized service through the brands they already have relationships with — their banks and investment advisors, their phone service providers, insurance companies, favorite stores and other trusted organizations. For instance, a bank might offer Watson directly to customers on web sites and mobile devices to help give them insights regarding retirement and various types of savings instruments like 401K accounts.
All good and well, but IBM might want to fix one flaw with their cyber call-centre worker. Engineers had to fit a bad language filter after teaching Watson a load of naughty words . If it can't cope with the odd swear word, how on earth will it cope with foul-mouthed customers (such as the infamous angry BT customer rung by their telesales department ) reaching the end of their collective tether? ®

Apple CEO Cook testifies before Senate panel after report says it avoids billions in taxes
(J. Scott Applewhite/ Associated Press ) - Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, May 21, 2013, before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent subcommittee on Investigations as lawmakers examine the methods employed by multinational corporations to shift profits offshore and how such activities are affected by the Internal Revenue Code. Lawmakers want to know the tax strategy of how Apple, the world’s most valuable company, based in Cupertino, Calif., holds a billion dollars in an Irish subsidiary as a tax strategy, according to a report issued this week by the subcommittee.
May 21, 2013 09:50 PM EDT
AP
WASHINGTON — The Senate dragged Apple Inc., the world’s most valuable company, into the debate over the U.S. tax code Tuesday, grilling CEO Tim Cook over allegations that its Irish subsidiaries help the company avoid billions in U.S. taxes.
Cook said the subsidiaries have nothing to do with reducing its U.S. taxes, a message he struggled to convey to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
“We pay all the taxes we owe — every single dollar,” Cook said. “We don’t depend on tax gimmicks.”
The senate subcommittee released a report Monday that held up Apple as an example of the legal tax avoidance made possible by the U.S. tax code. It estimates that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion in U.S. federal taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using its tax strategy, and described a complex setup involving Irish subsidiaries as being a key element of this strategy.
But Cook said the Irish subsidiaries don’t reduce the company’s U.S. taxes at all. Rather, the company avoids paying the 35 percent federal tax rate on profits made overseas by not bringing those profits back to the U.S., a practice it shares with other multinationals.
Apple’s enormous, iPhone-fueled profits mean that it has more cash stashed overseas than any other company: $102 billion.
Cook reaffirmed Apple’s position that given the current U.S. tax rate, it has no intention of bringing that cash back to the U.S. Like other companies, it has a responsibility to shareholders to pay as little as possible in taxes.
In effect, Apple is holding out for a lower corporate tax rate, and Cook spent some of his time in the spotlight to advocate for one, accompanied by a streamlining of the tax code to eliminate deductions and credits.
Cook, who is more accustomed to commanding a stage in front of investors and techies than facing a congressional committee, took a defensive tone with his opening statement. He punched out words when stressing the 600,000 jobs that the company supports while adding that Apple is the nation’s largest corporate taxpayer.
At the same time, Cook said he was happy to appear to be able to give Apple’s side of the story.
“I’m saying it’s who we are as people. ... Wherever we are, we’re an American company,” Cook insisted when asked about Apple’s use of affiliate companies in Ireland.
It was the first time an Apple CEO testified before Congress. Cook did so voluntarily. He appeared with Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and Head of Tax Operations Phillip Bullock.
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the panel’s chairman, said Apple’s use of loopholes in the U.S. tax code is unique among multinational corporations.
Apple uses five companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, according to the Congressional report. The companies are located at the same address in Cork, Ireland, and they share members of their boards of directors. While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country. That means the other three aren’t legally required to pay taxes in Ireland because they aren’t managed or controlled in that country, in Apple’s view.

http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/05/21/watson-will-be-taking-your-calls-now/|Watson will be taking your calls now
By Michal Lev-Ram, writer May 21, 2013: 7:02 AM ET
IBM's supercomputer is getting a job in customer service.
FORTUNE -- It's still a sluggish job market out there, but apparently not for supercomputers. IBM's question-answering machine Watson , best known for beating lowly humans on Jeopardy!, just got a new job. According to the tech giant, Watson will now be employed in customer service centers, used as a tool for both representatives and consumers to get fast, data-driven responses.
It's been two years since Watson made its debut on Jeopardy!. Since then, IBM ( IBM ) and a handful of beta customers have tested the supercomputer's chops in the medical field , where Watson can assist physicians in diagnosing different kinds of cancers and evaluate the best course of treatment, taking into account mountains of medical journals, electronic health records, and other data sets. IBM has always had big plans for Watson and has talked about its potential in all sorts of verticals, not just health care (and game shows). And now we know Watson's next career move: trying to improve the far-from-glamorous call center industry.
MORE:  The only company that's grown faster than Apple
"We believe that Watson is going to create a whole new class of applications that have the capability for questions and answers and that learns over time," says Manoj Saxena, general manager of Watson Solutions. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has also hinted at Watson's future, recently telling Fortune that " ... we are also now about to come out with Watson in what we consider as an advisor, and it will be in volume around research-oriented industries. Think of things like pharma; or as a client advisor in industries that have huge numbers of end retail clients. And so, think of financial services, think of a telco."
The newest flavor of Watson will be called the "Watson Engagement Advisor" and will help customer service agents and end customers find the answers to their questions via an "Ask Watson" feature available through mobile devices, online chat sessions, email, and other means. IBM says the Watson Engagement Advisor will be able to "quickly address customers' questions, offer advice to guide their purchase decisions, and troubleshoot their problems." In other words, if you thought it was hard getting to a live customer service representative before, it could soon get much, much harder (on the plus side, you'll get to interact with a computer with more computer power and memory than the human brain).
Brands like Nielsen ( NLSN ), Celcom, and Royal Bank of Canada ( RY ) are exploring ways they can use Watson to improve their customer service process. IBM's Saxena says an insurance company could use its supercomputer to quickly suggest personalized products. "That kind of interaction today requires the customer service person to have a lot of knowledge about the products that are available and how to match them to customers using their age and other data."
MORE:  All Yahoo's spending can't make it cool again
Consumer research firm Nielsen plans to experiment with using Watson to assist media planners and advertisers. "They're swimming in oceans and oceans of data but it's still hard to answer simple questions like how much to spend next year and how to optimize spending in real time to improve impact," says Randall Beard, global head of advertiser solutions for Nielsen.
Regardless of how Watson fares in its call center job, its future could be very bright. IBM says the supercomputer has gotten faster, smarter, and smaller, all attributes that will help increase its chances of becoming more mainstream (the original Watson was the size of a large bedroom; the current product is the size of four pizza boxes). And the company is banking on embedding Watson into all sorts of its own apps and services. More importantly, IBM wants to open up its super-smart machine so that other companies can write applications on top of Watson -- that's slated for later this year. So where will Watson go next?

Researchers writing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters say they have developed a graphene-based ink that could be the beginnings of inkjet-printed graphene .
The team’s graphene-based ink is highly conductive and tolerant to bending, which could eventually pave the way for bendable tablet computers or electronic newspapers.
“Graphene has a unique combination of properties that is ideal for next-generation electronics, including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and chemical stability,” said Mark Hersam , professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. “By formulating an inkjet-printable ink based on graphene, we now have an inexpensive and scalable path for exploiting these properties in real-world technologies.”
The new method for mass-producing graphene can be carried out at room temperature using ethanol and ethyl cellulose to exfoliate graphite. This process minimizes residues and results in a powder with a high concentration of nanometer-sized graphene flakes.
The team demonstrated printing ink in multiple layers, each 14 nanometers thick, in order to create precise patterns. The ink’s conductivity remained unchanged, suggesting that it could be used to create foldable electronic devices.
Inkjet printing with graphene has remained a challenge because it is difficult to harvest a sufficient amount of graphene without compromising its electronic properties. The team’s method surpasses some of these challenges, opening up the door to a future with bendable smartphones.
Graphene was discovered in 2004, and scientists believe the material holds plenty of promise in the future. Scientists discovered the material by peeling off carbon layers from graphite using ordinary scotch tape. It is the world’s thinnest, strongest and most conductive material. Scientists could eventually use the material for applications like computer chips, broadband connections and drug delivery.
Researchers from the University of Manchester and National University of Singapore wrote in the journal Science about how graphene could lead to photovoltaic structures that could be placed on the outer walls of buildings to absorb sunlight . The team said they found that graphene could also help environmental conditions like temperature and brightness by directing energy to change the transparency and reflectivity of individual fixtures and windows.
“Such photoactive heterostructures add yet new possibilities, and pave the road for new types of experiments,” said Professor Kostya Novoselov of the University of Manchester. “As we create more and more complex heterostructures, so the functionalities of the devices will become richer, entering the realm of multifunctional devices.”

Google: Let a Billion Supercomputers Bloom
By QUENTIN HARDY
Boris Roessler/European Pressphoto Agency
Google’s strategy to beat Amazon.com and Microsoft in the global business for public clouds is now clear: Swarm ‘em.
At last week’s Google I/O developer’s conference, the search giant was at pains to closely tie Google Compute Engine, or G.C.E., its competitor to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure (and Rackspace, and a host of other public clouds) with Google App Engine, its Web application development service, as well as cloud storage. In effect, Google said it was a way for everyone to build really big businesses.
The plan seems to be similar to the way Google got big in search, maps and many other services: make the smallest developers worldwide into allies, and the competition won’t even see you coming.
“The power comes from thousands and millions of developers that we don’t see,” said Greg DeMichillie, the product manager for the Google Cloud Platform, which includes GCE, storage and Google App Engine.
The strategy has roots in the experience that Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, had from competing with Microsoft. At both Sun Microsystems, where he was chief technology officer, and Novell, where he was chief executive, Mr. Schmidt lost to Microsoft’s ability to create a network of software developers who wrote applications for the Windows operating system. When he got to Google, Mr. Schmidt outmaneuvered Microsoft by using the Web the way Microsoft used Windows.
Even though Google is now a massive company, it still tries to enlist developers the same way. Google announced last week that App Engine would start to allow development in the PHP scripting language, a software language aimed at writing for broad distribution on the Web.
“Embracing PHP is a great way to lower the barriers to entry” for developers, said Mr. DeMichillie, a veteran of both Amazon Web Services and Adobe. Thanks to the connection to G.C.E., he said, “it’s on Google App Engine, but it is ultimately scalable.”
Compute Engine and App Engine “will work together by applications that will become computationally intensive, or require a different function” that G.C.E. can provide, he said. “Then it will hand data to App Engine to work with.”
It’s intriguing to think of individual developers using Google’s systems to reach billions of people, or the number-crunching of supercomputers lashed together from Google’s cloud. But competitors are wise to Google’s “up from nowhere” strategy by now, however. Amazon also made its cloud business as a place where start-ups could buy cheap computing.
Microsoft, for its part, is combining its still-popular applications with Azure’s capabilities in both computing and machine learning in the hope of bringing powerful new life to its installed base of customers.
At first, Amazon’s technical resources were hard to use, but the service has become increasingly more accessible, much the way Google adopted PHP. Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S., still has more features than the Google offering. Microsoft, by most reports, is making slower progress.
With its monumental size, however, Amazon has also become interested in much bigger clients. On Tuesday Amazon said that its A.W.S. that runs for government agencies now meets security standards that will open it up to even more agencies. Amazon is also in the middle of a global tour aimed at the largest corporations, in addition to start-ups.
Google also said Google Compute Engine would move from “limited preview” for a few customers to “open preview” for everyone. “Open preview” is something like the “beta” sign that hung on Gmail and other Google services for years. When Compute Engine goes into general availability it will be a sign that Google is supremely confident about the product’s reliability, which has been a knock on A.W.S..
“We are focused on performance,” said Mr. DeMichillie. “We will be able to start up in tens of seconds, not minutes, with consistent performance, and cost efficiency.”

What if you never had to worry about food again?
For many people, on many occasions, food is a hassle, especially when trying to eat well. Suppose we had a default meal that was the nutritional equivalent of water: cheap, healthy, convenient and ubiquitous. Soylent will be personalized for different body types and customizable based on individual goals. It allows one to enjoy the health benefits of a well balanced diet with less effort and cost.
 
Soylent Version 0.6
For anyone that struggles with allergies, heartburn, acid reflux or digestion, has trouble controlling weight or cholesterol, or simply doesn't have the means to eat well, soylent is for you.
Soylent frees you from the time and money spent shopping, cooking and cleaning, puts you in excellent health, and vastly reduces your environmental impact by eliminating much of the waste and harm coming from agriculture, livestock, and food-related trash.
There are problems with the current state of food
50% of the food produced globally is wasted, and food makes for the largest component of municipal garbage. If not for this waste there would be plenty of food to adequately nourish everyone alive. 2 million people are killed annually by smoke inhalation from indoor cooking stoves alone. 70% of americans are overweight or obese. 1 in 7 people globally are malnourished, and 1 in 3 in the developing world suffer from deficiency. Countless others are living hand-to-mouth, subsistence farming, hindering economic development. Even in the developed world, agriculture is the most dangerous industry to work in by occupational injuries and illnesses, and obesity is on the rise.
By taking years to spoil, dramatically reducing cost, and easing transportation and storage, soylent could have a dramatic effect on hunger and malnutrition. Proceeds from the purchase of soylent enable us to work with aid partners and reduce hunger and environmental impact both in the United States and the developing world.
Think about what the future of food looks like. Imagine everyone having a customized, efficient, nutritious default diet and the freedom to eat for leisure as desired. It is a bright, healthy future indeed.
What the early adopters are saying
"I've lost weight. I have lots of energy...Drinking soylent allows me to feel in a precise manner the difference between actual biologically-motivated hunger and the simple wanting of food."
 "The cognitive effects are extremely noticeable, in fact the most noticeable for me."  
"So far I've noticed a lot of what you all have been mentioning: healthier skin, less fatigue, focus even with less sleep."
"My mood experience! It has improved a lot lately. And by a lot, I mean A LOT." 
"The taste is awesome." 
"The time and money saved is making me really happy. Especially the time."
"As a Biologist/Chemist I approve of Soylent and really want to start using it."
The Team
Rob Rhinehart - CEO
Rob is a Y Combinator alumnus with professional experience in electrical engineering, computer science and entrepreneurship. Lacking the means to eat well, he invented Soylent as a more efficient approach to nutrition and hopes to use it to reduce the global disparity of health.
Matt Cauble - COO
Matt graduated from Georgia Tech in 2011 with a degree in Industrial and Systems engineering. He has worked in finance, procurement, and logistics. Most recently, Matt was part of Y Combinator in the Summer of 2012. Matt is responsible for internal project development and marketing for Soylent.
John Coogan - CTO
John manages Soylent's web presence which includes sales, finance, and marketing.  Prior to Soylent, John worked worked in finance, as well as mid and early stage technology companies.  He has an Economics degree from Northeastern University and is enamored with Big Data and anything that increases his efficiency.
David Renteln - VP Business Development/Sales 
David brings broad experience in operations and sales to Soylent where he sets up strategic business partnerships and drives the sales channels. Prior to this, he was the first employee at a biotech devices start up and co-founded an education technology company. David graduated from Harvard with a degree in Human Evolutionary Biology, where he also served as President of the Harvard Rugby Team.
Risks & Challenges
Funds raised from the campaign will be used primarily to cover up front manufacturing costs, meaning the price will decrease with time and scale.
Soylent will be produced in an FDA-approved facility with strict regulatory controls ensuring safety.
All scale production efforts have the potential for setbacks including supplier issues, manufacturing issues, sourcing, contaminants, and proper control.
Delays are possible, but we are already working with industry experts to ensure a smooth initial manufacturing run.
Unfortunately due to regulatory constraints, our initial runs of Soylent will be available within the United States only. We are diligently working to provide it worldwide as soon as possible.

Last week during Google I/O, Google sent Microsoft a cease and desist letter demanding that the company remove its YouTube app from its Windows Phone Store by May 22. The letter stated that the Microsoft-made app violated YouTube’s terms of service by stripping out ads and letting people download videos.
A day ahead of Google’s requested removal date, a Microsoft spokeswoman provided Wired with the following comment:
“YouTube is consistently one of the top apps downloaded by smartphone users on all platforms, but Google has refused to work with us to develop an app on par with other platforms. Since we updated the YouTube app to ensure our mutual customers a similar YouTube experience, ratings and feedback have been overwhelmingly positive. We’d be more than happy to include advertising but need Google to provide us access to the necessary APIs. In light of Larry Page’s comments calling for more interoperability and less negativity, we look forward to solving this matter together for our mutual customers.”
Though Microsoft would not confirm, the statement suggests that the company has no intention of removing its YouTube app by tomorrow to meet Google’s deadline. Wired has also reached out to Google for additional comment.

http://www.geek.com/games/xbox-one-has-mandatory-game-installs-additional-charge-for-disc-re-use-1555995/|Games By Matthew Humphries May. 21, 2013 3:05 pm
Back in March, the Xbox One XDK suggested that game installs on the new console were mandatory and the game disc would not be used during play. It turns out that was, for the most part, true.
Microsoft has confirmed that every game you want to play on the Xbox One needs to be installed on the hard drive first. Microsoft states that the benefit of this for the gamer is the lack of a need to keep the game disc inserted when you want to play. However, there’s a flip side to that–playing that copy of the game will be limited to just one Xbox Live account.
If you want to use the same game disc with another Xbox Live account, you’ll have to pay an additional charge. While this doesn’t entirely confirm that the Xbox One will require you to pay extra if you purchase a used game, it’s certainly going to limit that market.
A lot depends on whether there’s a way to unlink the game from your Xbox One once you are finished playing. If you can’t, then selling the game used would mean the buyer pays you for the disc, but then also has to pay Microsoft another fee to get the game to install. Alternatively, the ability to unlink the disc may allow a sale, but Microsoft will probably attempt to collect the additional fee on reinstall anyway.
It seems likely Microsoft will want to keep things simple by making selling a game a complicated affair. And even if it is relatively simple, Microsoft will make money from every used game sale on the Xbox One due to this additional charge for installs.
Microsoft will surely get asked repeatedly about the installation feature in the coming days, so hopefully we’ll get a definitive answer from them as to how it will work. What’s surprising is that the Xbox One only has a 500GB hard drive, meaning you’ll be quite limited on how many games you can have installed at any one time unless there’s support for external hard drives.

http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4414756/Qualcomm--Samsung-pass-AMD-in-microprocessor-sales|Qualcomm, Samsung pass AMD in microprocessor sales
Dylan McGrath
5/21/2013 1:45 AM EDT
SAN FRANCISCO—Qualcomm Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. each passed Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in microprocessor sales in 2012, thanks to a slowdown in PC sales coupled with strong growth in smartphone and media tablet sales, according to market research firm IC Insights Inc.
The displacement of AMD—which had been the No. 2 supplier of MPUs behind Intel Corp. since the 1990s—underscores the disruption caused by the rise of smartphones and tablets at the expense of PCs.  The new top 10 MPU list shows most leading suppliers of mobile processors based on ARM technology moving higher in the ranking while PC-dependent x86 MPU companies—Intel and AMD—continued to lose marketshare in 2012.
Among the top 10 MPU suppliers,  only top-ranked Intel and fourth-place AMD sell processors built with x86 microarchitectures for standard notebook and desktop PCs running Windows operating system software from Microsoft.  The remaining top 10 suppliers develop and sell mobile MPUs with RISC processor cores licensed from ARM.
Qualcomm, which dominates to the baseband IC market, has largely been successful in selling its Snapdragon applications processors. Samung sells its own ARM-based processors and is also the sole foundry for Apple Inc.'s Ax series of processors for its iPhones and iPads.
Sales of the ARM-based Snapdragon SoCs increased 28 percent in 2012 to $5.3 billion, increasing Qualcomm's MPU marketshare to 9.4 percent, IC Insights said. Samsung—including Apple’s MPU foundry business—moved to third place in the 2012 ranking from fourth in 2011 with a 78 percent increase in MPU sales, IC Insights said. About 83 percent of Samsung’s $4.7 billion in MPU revenues in 2012 came from Apple’s processors, IC Insights said.
Wow my lovely TI, they are growing. GoGo!!!..TI.
Thanks.

Based on mobile desing wins I see, Intel's numbers will continue to decline in 2H-2013.  zero silvermount availability in Q3 .... Limited in even Q4.
Why is Intel so late with 22nm in mobile?    All intel atoms still on 32 nm now and will remain so for most if not all of 2013.
While Qualcomm has beem shipping 28 nm in mobile space for over a year already
Mr. FA
5/21/2013 9:00 AM EDT
I'm not sure why Apple's A"x" series chips count in Samsung's basket while the rest of the fabless/fablight guys show under the their company and not the foundry(ie qualcomm)?
Shouldn't Apple be added to the list and a correction be made?
m00nshine
5/21/2013 9:20 AM EDT
Because fabless and fab light still sell their chips to end user.  Apple is end user who buys chips from samsung.  So samsung sells the chips and is therefore the supplier as the title suggests.
m00nshine
5/21/2013 9:59 AM EDT
Althought I could argue for same reason, AMD should not be listed on this one, but also complicated since AMD doesn't manufacture (ie GF, TSMC), but also acts as reseller to customer other than themself.
bmccleanicinsights
5/21/2013 12:02 PM EDT
After toying with the idea of listing Apple separately, the bottom line is that Apple is not an MPU supplier, they are an end user.  As you mention, all of the fabless suppliers re-sell their MPUs and are correctly included as suppliers.
The Samsung/Apple case is an example of why not all foundry sales should be excluded when attempting to create marketshare data.  With most of Samsung's sales sold to Apple,  since Apple does not re-sell these devices, counting these foundry sales as Samsung MPU sales does not introduce double counting.
It should be noted that of the $32 billion in 2012 pure-play foundry sales from TSMC, GF, UMC, etc., only $200 million was to system houses like Apple.
CACHE
5/21/2013 7:33 PM EDT
Hi Bill, Apple is designing their own MPU now for some time, how will you handle when they start using tsmc instead of samsung?
Similarly other folks like Nvidia who are starting to directly sell products (shield w/ tegra4), will these parts be calculated back to TSMC?
bmccleanicinsights
5/21/2013 8:06 PM EDT
That's a good question!  When TSMC ramps up production of Apple processors we will need to look at what makes the most sense.  Do you call Apple a "supplier" of MPUs (supplying to itself?) or do you put those sales under a pure-play foundry such as TSMC and list TSMC as an MPU supplier?  One thing for certain, these Apple MPU sales will need to go to TSMC or Apple or they won't be counted at all, and that really isn't an option.

Stanford women's tennis finished one of the most spectacular runs in school history -- regardless of sport. The Cardinal defeated the no. 1, no. 3, no. 4, and no. 5 teams in the country within the span of five days. As a whole, Stanford has now won an NCAA title in at least one sport in 37 consecutive years.
Follow @DavidMLombardi
Simply put, Stanford women's tennis just treated fans to one of the most spectacular runs in school history. In the same year that David Shaw's football team defeated five consecutive Top 25 teams to smell Roses, this tennis squad knocked off four Top 5 programs in less than a week to attain national glory.
Just over a week ago, Stanford's chances of winning an NCAA title in the 2012-2013 academic year took a seemingly crippling blow when the Cardinal women's water polo team suffered a gut-wrenching, five-overtime, 10-9 loss to USC in the national championship game. Stanford's had won a national title in at least one sport for 36 consecutive years, but it certainly appeared that streak was dying an excruciating death.
Over the past five days, though, Lele Forood's club delivered an 11th hour run for the ages to rescue Stanford's cherished streak. Her 12th-seeded Cardinal women's tennis team upended no. 1 Florida , no. 4 Georgia , and no. 5 USC to punch a ticket to Tuesday's national championship match against no. 3 Texas A&M.
The Aggies gave Stanford a jolt, but Cardinal stalwart Nicole Gibbs roared to life after losing the first eight games to Cristina Sanchez-Quintanar, the country's fourth-ranked player. In a spectacular run that is sure to be forever embedded in Stanford lore, Gibbs won 12 straight games to capture her match and put the Cardinal in position for the hardware.
Junior Kristie Ahn delivered the kill against the Aggies' Cristina Stancu, and the Cardinal mobbed on the Champaign, Illinois courts for the fourth time in five days. New heroes were born on a nightly basis -- literally. Freshman Krista Hardebeck had saved Stanford against no. 1 Florida the night before, rallying from a 5-1 second-set deficit while facing elimination to win and push her team into Tuesday's final.
The Great Streak lives: at least one Stanford team has now won an NCAA title in 37 consecutive years. The last time one of the school's teams didn't win an NCAA title in an academic year, Gerald Ford was President of the United States.
Stanford women's tennis has also now won 17 NCAA titles (18 total national crowns), far and away the best mark of any program in the nation. Hardebeck, the team's freshman hero, is only 18 years old, so Stanford has won a national championship for every year of her life.
Moreover, the Cardinal are also still very much alive in their quest for their 19th consecutive Directors' Cup. According to The Bootleg's exclusive projection (compiled before this spectacular tennis run), Stanford narrowly trailed Florida in the Directors' Cup standings. The Cardinal's win over the Gators in the tennis semifinal and this subsequent title has certainly tightened the gap. Stay tuned to our coverage of this heated race.

Sergio Garcia 's verbal sparring with Tiger Woods continued Tuesday night in Europe with what could be perceived as a racial reference aimed at the world's No. 1 player for which the Spaniard later issued an apology.
Garcia, who took issue with Woods for what he viewed as a breach of golf course etiquette during the third round of The Players Championship two weeks ago, was asked in jest at a European Tour function if he would be inviting Woods to dinner during next month's U.S. Open.

Sergio Garcia (left) was in a joking mood at the European Tour awards dinner Tuesday night in England, where he shared the stage with Luke Donald and Nicolas Colsaerts, then later made a controversial remark about Tiger Woods.
"We'll have him round every night,'' Garcia said, according to multiple media reports. "We will serve fried chicken.''
"Fried chicken" references are associated as racial stereotypes with African-Americans. A similar comment got Fuzzy Zoeller in trouble following the 1997 Masters, when he quipped that fried chicken would be served at the following year's champions' dinner, which Woods would host as defending champion.
According to media reports, Garcia left the European Tour awards dinner Tuesday night at the BMW PGA Championship in Virginia Water, England, before he could be questioned. He later issued a statement through the European Tour.
"I apologize for any offense that may have been caused by my comment on stage during the European Tour Players' Awards dinner,'' Garcia said. "I answered a question that was clearly made towards me as a joke with a silly remark, but in no way was the comment meant in a racist manner.''
The back-and-forth between Garcia and Woods has continued long after the conclusion of the Players, where Woods won his fourth tournament of the year a day after Garcia complained about being distracted on the second hole by the world's top-ranked player and his playing partner that round.

Their accounts of what happened late were disputed by different marshals on the hole, and neither player has backed down. On Monday, at a media day for the AT&T National in Washington, D.C., Woods was asked if he would reach out to Garcia to clear the air. Woods drew laughter when he simply said: "No.''
Earlier Tuesday, Garcia was again asked about Woods in a news conference at Wentworth, host of the BMW PGA.
"I mean, you can't like everybody," Garcia said. "I think that there's people that you connect with and there's people that you don't. You know, it's pretty much as simple as that. I think that he doesn't need me in his life, I don't need him in mine, and let's move on and keep doing what we're doing.''
Asked when his issues with Woods began, Garcia said: "A while back. It's never really been like a true connection like I would have maybe with Luke Donald or Lee Westwood or Adam Scott or some of the other guys that I get along with well."

So as he watched the horrifying images Monday as a tornado ripped through suburban Moore, the emotions came bubbling to the surface and so did the need to help. Durant pledged $1 million for tornado relief through his foundation on Tuesday, eager to help a devastated area begin to rebuild.
“
As the day went on and I saw the footage and the casualties and the houses being blown away, it was tough to see. I call Oklahoma City my home. I go through Moore all the time. It's unfortunate. We're going to come together as a city like we always do and we're going to bounce back.
”
-- Kevin Durant's reaction to Oklahoma tornado
"As the day went on and I saw the footage and the casualties and the houses being blown away, it was tough to see," said Durant, who was in Minneapolis to watch longtime friend Monica Wright play a preseason game for the Minnesota Lynx. "I call Oklahoma City my home. I go through Moore all the time. It's unfortunate. We're going to come together as a city like we always do and we're going to bounce back."
Durant has been in Oklahoma City for five years now, ever since the Seattle SuperSonics moved there in 2008. He's become a fixture in the community, in addition to establishing himself as one of the very best players in the NBA. He said he was hoping to return home Wednesday to try and lift the spirits of an area reeling from the deaths of some two dozen people, including children.
"Just to get to the hospital, see some kids," Durant said. "Something. Just something to give some hope. Playing for the Thunder, we mean so much to the state. So many people support us and I just want to go back and support those people."
The American Red Cross said the gift from Durant's foundation is meant to match other donations and be an incentive for more people to give. The Thunder also announced a $1 million donation, as did the NBA and players' union.
"Our hearts go out to all those affected by the devastation that has occurred within our community this week," Thunder chairman Clay Bennett said in a statement issued by the team. "We are focusing Thunder resources to help where we can in the relief efforts and to support the organizations that are on the ground assisting those affected by this week's storms. Even with so much loss, the strength and resiliency of this community have once again been on display, and we will continue to work together as our community and state recover from this disaster."
When Durant initially heard reports of a tornado near Oklahoma City, he didn't pay them much mind. A veteran of the area now, he knows twisters can be a regular occurrence this time of year. It quickly became apparent that this one was different, and Durant could barely watch it all unfold.
"It hit so close to home," he said. "It was tough to see."
And it made the Thunder's early exit from the playoffs sting that much more. With Russell Westbrook out because of a knee injury, the Thunder were beaten by the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference semifinals, a disappointing finish for a team that advanced to the NBA Finals a year ago.
"I wish I could've done a better job for my team to stay in the playoffs because of course basketball and sporting events bring everyone together," Durant said. "It takes your mind off it for a few hours."
The Thunder boast one of the most loyal and passionate fan bases in the league. Durant averaged 30.8 points, 9.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists in the playoffs, but the rest of his teammates struggled to step up and fill Westbrook's void.
"There's some part of me wishing I could've played better for my team to stay in the playoffs," Durant said. "Hopefully they get back on their feet. It's so tough. Praying for the families. I'm feeling for them."

I like the way that baseball allows you to be drafted multiple times without penalty. Why don't basketball and football players have the option to go back to school? I understand that there are many, many more picks in baseball so you can take a low cost risk on someone late in the draft. There should at least be an option for the players to return if they are undrafted. Someone please explain this to me.

Walking His Life Away
For race walker Albert Heppner, making the 2004 U.S. Olympic team was all-important -- perhaps, in the end, too important�
By Gary Smith

Who knows why? In two weeks they'll light the world's largest wick, let some white birds loose and then start lining up men and women from around the earth to see who can run the fastest from here to there. The fastest down straightaways, around curves, over barricades, through puddles, even clenching metal sticks. Who knows why? For days you'll sit in front of your TV and watch all of these races. Except for one.
It's the oddest and longest footrace, the one that forbids the competitors to go as fast as they can -- in fact, that forces them to walk. It's the one Olympic race you'll scoff at, at first. Then ignore.
That's the race I'll be watching closest. See, I know what happened one day five months ago in the race to get to this race. I know how much can be at stake when a man takes a four-hour walk: Everything.
Al Heppner was the first race walker to arrive. He appeared just as dawn did on the U.S. Olympic Trials 50-kilometer course at Chula Vista Marina, a few miles south of San Diego. His stomach hurt. He hadn't slept. No one had ever wanted a race as badly as he wanted this one.
The others began to materialize in the wan gray light on that Sunday in February: the race officials, the media, the walkers and their dearest friends and loved ones, along with a few dozen high school cheerleaders that the event's organizer had mustered to create noise and excitement.
No one else cared about race walking. No one else would watch men or women walk that funny walk for hour after hour. Neither the NCAA nor the U.S. and European pro track circuits bothered to hold the event. Bob Costas, NBC's Olympics host, would say that having a race to see who can walk the fastest is like having a contest to see who can whisper the loudest.
The walkers assembled for the 7:30 a.m. start. They'd all long since made it to the other side of mirth and disdain. They'd all had seven-year-olds follow them and ape their pumping arms and swaying hips. They'd all heard 20-year-olds barrel by in rusting cars and scream Fag! at them on country roads. They'd all shed their need for the world's approval, attuned their ears and hearts to an inner voice. Except for one.
Al stood out. He was the 5'8" pied piper of race walking, the 29-year-old with the munchkin's cackle who was loved by everyone in his fringe fraternity. The one so loud that other walkers would remind him to use his indoor voice. So vulnerable that he'd sob on a stranger's shoulder after being disqualified from a race. So exuberant that he'd end up on the dance floor at a postrace party, his shirt soaked, juking like no Jew ever juked, encircled by people chanting, "Go, Al! Go, Al! Go, Jiggy!" Rabbi Jiggy. That was just one of his nicknames.
"Don't make it happen, Al," fellow race walker Dave McGovern counseled him at the starting line. "Let it happen." Al nodded. He had heard it a thousand times: Patience. Stay inside yourself. Walk the first 25K slower than the last 25K. Don't try to bust open a 31-mile race early. It's lethal, Al.
Only he and four other Americans -- Curt Clausen, Philip Dunn, Sean Albert and Tim Seaman -- had a real shot at the four-hour time necessary to qualify for the Athens Olympics. No more than three could go. They'd all trained together every day for years at the ARCO Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista.
Foremost loomed Curt, the reigning U.S. champ, the gritty U.S. champ determined to make his third straight Olympics, then return to law school. Philip, the quiet bookworm -- Al turned inside out -- had been Al's enemy a few years earlier, the two of them forever clashing for the third berth on national teams, but who could sustain anger at a puppy like Jiggy? Mild-mannered Sean seemed on the verge of breaking the four-hour barrier for the first time, nearly in command of his long legs and arms in this cruelly mechanical event. Tim, Al's fiery roommate at Wisconsin-Parkside, was a 20K specialist who had said he'd likely stay in the race for 30K and then pull out, use it for conditioning ... or was he lying in the weeds, ready to pounce if he saw a chance to steal an Olympic berth at 50K?
"Go, Al!" a fan screamed as the gun sounded and the walkers took off. Who wouldn't root for him? He was the greeter at the gate, the man who popped up from his moonlighting post behind the customer-service desk at the training center dining hall and showed all the newcomers where to get their mail, their rubdowns, their grub, then helped them haul in all their belongings, thrilled to welcome one and all -- Americans and foreigners, swimmers, skiers, shot-putters, shortstops -- to the fantasy factory in the Southern California desert. He'd carry his lunch tray to the far table where a new arrival ate alone. He'd take the Honduran cyclist to the airport at 5 a.m., beg the outraged decathlete to make peace with the offending kayaker, concoct nicknames for them all. Hey, V-Dub! Big John Stud, my man! What's happenin', Apples? He turned his cramped dorm room into the campus lounge, the gathering place for field trips organized by camp counselor Al to the amusement park, beach, ball games, bars and dance clubs. He turned all these masters of abstruse and exotic athletic skills into the most unexpected thing: a family.
"You can do it, Al!" came the cries as he and the four other favorites, in a cluster, fired away from the pack. Al settled into rhythm and felt the nightmare of the 50K begin: his heart pumping hard enough to generate 3 to 3 1/2 steps per second, equivalent to the rate of a 100-meter sprinter, pumping even harder than a marathon runner's heart because he had to use more of his body to create locomotion and then maintain that rate for nearly two hours longer. His gait requiring a gymnast's explosive strength in the hips and hamstrings, a dancer's fluidity. The mental strain unrelenting, because if he fatigued or lost focus covering those 31 miles at a 7:40-per-mile clip, he could violate one of race walking's two bedrock rules and be disqualified. One rule stipulated that his lead leg remain straight from the moment of contact with the ground till the leg passed beneath his hips. Al could usually follow that one. The other one, the rule that tortured him no end, decreed that at least one foot be in contact with the racecourse -- both feet could never be off the ground at the same time.
Agony loves company. That's why most 50Ks began the way this one did. The best walkers broke away and forged an unspoken pact, one man doing the hard slogging out front for a few minutes, cutting wind resistance, then dropping back and drafting behind the next leader, each man drawing psychological comfort from the group for 35 or 40 kilometers, functioning on trust. Trust that his competitors would sustain a pace that would keep him on target. Deeper trust, in himself, that he'd have what it takes to devour them all in the jungle of the final 10 kilometers.
For the first seven kilometers Al, Curt, Philip, Tim and Sean upheld the agreement. Then Curt grabbed a handful of toilet paper from a tabletop and began to surge away.
What should Al do? Stay with Curt, the race walking sages had advised him. After all, they said, he knows the 50K's secrets and trip wires the way a husband knows his wife's. Let him take you to a 3:58 finish, Al, take you all the way to Athens.
But now Curt, far too early, was pulling away. Did the tissue paper in his hand mean what it seemed to, that he was about to make a toilet stop and was speeding up to compensate for the time he was about to lose? Or could it be a ruse?
Al's competitive lust had cost him before. Once, when he was six and his father's bike moved ahead of his, he'd pedaled so furiously that he'd pitched over the handlebars and broken his arm. At camp six years later he broke his arm again, astonishing counselors who had never seen a boy dive with such fury in a friendly game of Capture the Flag. Too many times he'd been disqualified from races because he couldn't restrain his urge to go faster, faster, couldn't keep both feet on the ground.
Curt's lead increased. The race walkers all let him go, mindful of that toilet paper. Except for one.
No, Al, No.... Those who knew race walking muttered those three words as he went after Curt. They all wanted to protect Al. They all knew the story of Al and the monsoon in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. They all knew how he'd had one of the three Olympic berths in the bag that day, leaning into the 30 mph winds and frigid downpour to share the lead with Curt and Andrew Hermann, opening up a seemingly insurmountable 2 1/2-minute advantage over Philip Dunn after 37 kilometers when Philip pulled a hamstring and stopped dead. How Al had slowed a little then, had lost the protection of the other two walkers and begun to shiver, then shake and finally shut down with hypothermia, watching in a daze as Philip bit back the pain and stormed past him to become the third Olympian. How Al had swooned into a race official's arms before the finish, been cocooned in blankets for an hour before comprehending the catastrophe and weeping. Then lapsed into a deeper fog, finally departing from the Olympic Training Center by mutual consent because no man that depressed could remain there.
If only Al had done what the other walkers had done before the race: put on a T-shirt beneath his singlet. But then, people were always saying, "Al, what were you thinking?" The first oven he ever owned caught fire because Al thought that he was supposed to keep oven mitts in the oven. One night his roommate at Chula Vista, triple jumper Von Ware, returned from a three-day road trip during a rainstorm and found all his shoes on their balcony because Al had decided to rearrange their dorm room. The balcony had no overhang. Ware's shoes were soaked, and one sneaker contained a swallow's nest with four eggs. Ware wanted to wring Jiggy's neck as the swallow dove and pecked and shrieked at them, but how could he? Al was his, and everyone else's, little brother.
Al's six-month depression after the 2000 trials frightened all of them. For half the day Al would lie in bed or on a couch, staring at floors, at ceilings, at SportsCenter repeats. "No, Al, no," they pleaded when he told them he was joining the U.S. Army that August.
But everyone was wrong. Boot camp jolted Al out of his depression, the Army accepted him into its World Class Athlete Program, and -- bingo! -- that December, Specialist Albert Heppner was back. Back in race walking, back in the ARCO Olympic Training Center, back in his old dorm room, back in the family. His old buoyant self again, leaping out of his car to dance the Electric Slide with a pretty pole vaulter on the side of the road at 2 a.m., another of those women whose relationships with Al didn't quite pan out. And now, back in the U.S. Olympic Trials, chasing his redemption, closing in on Curt in kilometer 10.
It wasn't a ruse. Curt peeled off the course and ducked into the portable toilet. Al, the man who needed people all around him, looked back. He was way out front, all alone.
What should Al do? The men behind him had stuck together for years, and Al was their glue. He exchanged gifts and shared holiday meals with them, played hoops in Mexico and gasped for oxygen with them during altitude training in the Andes. He was the mediator, the one who needed most to be liked ... and yet the one who'd turn grim and silent a few weeks before a big race, torch the pace that coach Enrique Pe�a set for them in training, take off and turn practices into wars.
The contradiction of his two needs -- for love and conquest -- contorted him, confounded him, churned again and again in his training log entries: Focus on yourself! In how many other athletic disciplines would America's highest-ranked rivals find themselves together on a five-hour hike at the bottom of a gorge, as they did a few days after last Thanksgiving in the mountains west of San Diego, marveling as they stared 450 feet up at the Pine Valley Bridge, the highest in the U.S. interstate system? Chortling together after Al reached into a thatch of poison oak and then made matters worse, much worse, when he took a pee?
Now Al faced the second critical juncture in the race of his life, a decision that cried out for the least of his skills: calculation. He could slow his pace and rejoin the others, as the cognoscenti hoped. Or he could roll the dice, maintain his pace and his lead, begin to sow doubt in his competitors' hearts. After all, he'd left the pack and walked a sub-four-hour 50K once before, a 3:58:45 second-place finish to the late-charging Curt in the 1999 U.S. nationals. He was in better shape now, the best condition of his life, and better form too, having surprised even himself by winning the award for best technique in a race just a few weeks before. Damn it all, he'd been beating every one of them, even Curt, in their daily training sessions over the past few weeks. Why should Al shadow Curt and settle for a second- or third-place ride to Athens when he could win and go in style?
Curt popped out of the john and fell in with the others. Al made up his mind. No, he wouldn't slow down and rejoin the men behind him. No, he wouldn't maintain his lead and his pace. He accelerated and began to pull farther away.
The numbers flashed on the website monitoring the race. The walking fraternity across the country joined the ones along the course murmuring those three words. No, Al, no....
His lead swelled to 30 seconds ... 45 ... a full minute! He heard his mother's squeaky voice imploring him onward. He glimpsed his father cheering him on too, no matter how perplexed the old man was. Seventy-one-year-old Max Heppner cared nothing for sports, couldn't fathom how a footrace had become life and death to his flesh and blood. As a child in the Netherlands he'd had to run for his life, hiding from the Nazis for three years in an attic, a barn, a windmill, a bathhouse, a chicken house.
Max lost his grandfather to the gas chambers, his father to disease and his companion in hiding -- a boy eight years older than he -- to a hammer blow from one of the people Max's father was paying to hide them from the Nazis. When the horror ended, he and his grief-ravaged mother washed ashore in America, where he eventually married and for 15 years tried to live as if the Holocaust hadn't happened to him, tried to muster the only response a man could make to six million deaths: creating one new life. Finally, when Max and his wife, Evelyn, had almost given up hope, came the miracle: Albert.
Then, four years later, the wallop. Max left his wife and son, having fallen in love with a therapist who'd lost relatives to the same butchers, a woman with whom he could finally talk about the depression and nightmares from all the memories he'd buried. Evelyn turned Al over to her sister in Cleveland and sank into depression too. Nobody could say how it all affected the boy, but he didn't take it sitting down. He bounced off walls, crawled under chairs, ricocheted through stores, ran circles around his house when he returned home to Columbia, Md., a few months later.
He kept slipping out of the quiet house, finding his way into a chair at neighbors' dinners, materializing in the empty seat at strangers' restaurant tables. Evelyn took him to see a play and nearly choked when she looked up during a dance number and saw Al on stage, shimmying for all he was worth. He ended up on Howard High's pep squad, the only white boy among a flock of African-American girls, bringing down the house with his hip-hop moves. Sure, depression was rampant among children of Holocaust survivors, but how could it catch that dynamo out there with the gold chain, backward cap and baggy clothes all a-flapping?
His father, by now, had found a mission. He'd joined a group of Holocaust survivors and organized an international seminar on the subject, begun delivering lectures and laying plans for two books and a movie he would produce about his family's experience, all under his new name, Amichai -- Hebrew for "my people live." Al stopped staying with him every other weekend and in summers. He wasn't going to be the son of a Jewish Holocaust survivor. He was going to be a winner, baby, red, white and blue.
One problem: He had to be an athlete first. He was too short and scrawny to play the all-American sports he adored, but there was one thing, God knows, that he could do: run circles. He became one of the top three distance runners at his high school, amazing teammates when he'd run off after races to run some more, but it wasn't enough. He wasn't the best. One day when he was 15, he and a buddy shook with laughter at a Junior Olympics meet as they watched some little kids bobbing around the track in a most peculiar way. "I'll do that next week," Al said. "You watch."
"Bet you a dollar you'll never do it," said his friend. Al entered the next week's 3K race walk, drawn to the strange discipline that both released and restrained his boundless energy but seduced even more by the heft of that first-place medal draped around his neck. So what if he was the only entrant in his age group?
His relatives and neighbors were astonished and relieved. The pinball had a path. A calling, like his father. The kid who couldn't afford college had an athletic scholarship. The boy who had to run would walk.
Curt veered to the toilet again. Philip and Sean, too, were wincing with stomach distress. Everyone was wrong. Al kept increasing his lead -- 1:30 ... 1:40 ... 1:45 -- as the halfway point blew by. His form was flawless. Out front, alone, he didn't have to struggle with his doubts or his impulse to run. Out front he commanded everyone's eyes.
This was better than the best night of his life, that magical eve in Poza Rica, Mexico, six years earlier, when Al -- dead last and racked with intestinal pain in a race the U.S. team had entered solely for conditioning -- defied his coach's order to stop after 30 kilometers, obeying instead the adoring cries of the female spectators who'd fallen for his baby-face grin, who waited five hours for him to finish and showered him with kisses, flowers and lollipops until security guards escorted him away. It was "a brief moment in my life," he wrote in an article, "that I will always treasure."
Yes, Al was race walking's bard. Singlehandedly, he'd solved his dilemma -- what if he became an Olympian and no one ever knew? -- by making sure people knew, by writing previews and wrap-ups of all his races, by collecting the e-mail addresses of everyone he met, nearly 500 of them, and sending his stories to them and to a half-dozen race walking periodicals and websites. The off-weeks he spiced with amusing Day in the Life of Al and His Fellow Walkers chronicles that were so well done that you'd wonder why he was walking his life away instead of spending it with all those other sports-smitten Jewish lads who couldn't jump or jack a curveball -- the ones in the press box.
At last, today, he wouldn't need to clang his own bell. His triumph would be in the San Diego newspaper -- who knew, might even merit a few lines in Sports Illustrated trumpeting Al Heppner, Olympian. An upgrade, for sure, over SI's Faces in the Crowd mention of his NAIA 5K championship in 1997, laminated on a plaque that hung on his wall. Sweeter than his appearance in the "Your Portfolio" feature in USA Today's Money section.
The small crowd filled his ears with the most heavenly music of all as he blew through the 30K mark: "U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!" Imagine how that would sound when he marched into the magic circle on the floor of the Olympic Stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies. Oh, rest assured, everyone back home would see Al. He'd come bursting out of the stadium tunnel, high-fiving Iverson and swapping e-mail addresses with LeBron, boogying with the Swedish synchronized swimmers and twirling the Canadian gymnasts round and round. He'd be mayor of the Olympic Village by the dawn of Day 2.
Thirty-two K's down. A two-minute lead over Curt and Tim, with Philip, more than a minute behind them, slowing down and about to throw up. All of it, every bit of Al's obsession, worth it now: the 100 miles a week of walking, the interval training so intense that even the 10,000-meter runners marveled at it, the sleepless nights in the $5,000 oxygen tent designed to simulate high altitude and increase red-blood-cell production, the arrows spray-painted on the roads in the neighborhoods of all the friends and relatives he visited out of town to mark his 15-mile routes. All the exhortations plastered on his walls -- get psyched!... believe it!... taste it all! All the details etched into his daily racing log for years: weight, pulse, heart rate, body fat, lactic acid level, mileage, times, temperature, weather, route location, goals.
Balance? Perspective? The all-eggs-in-one-basket stuff that Jim Bauman, the sports psychologist at the Olympic Training Center, and Al's parents worried about as the 2004 Olympic Trials drew nearer and memories of his 2000 crash returned? Sure, Al knew balance was important. But not too much balance, because somewhere out there some unbalanced sonofabitch who lived and breathed and slept the Olympics even more than Al did was waiting to kick his balanced ass. Somewhere some guy, burrowed even deeper in a tunnel to overcome enormous obstacles and reach the Games through sheer will and wanting, was being videotaped for an up-close-and-personal profile that would make eyes mist in homes across America.
"But what happens if you don't make it this time?" his mother fretted on the phone.
"Don't worry, Ma, this time I can handle it," he replied.
"There's a million other things you can do, Al."
"I have to get to the Olympics, Ma."
"But it's not going to change your life, Al," Tim Seaman chimed in. "I made the Olympics, and look where I'm living -- an apartment in the Mexican 'hood."
"I have to get to the Olympics, Tim."
They didn't understand. The dreamer had cased dreamland and found it: that one small window left ajar, that one entry for an ordinary athlete into the world's most extraordinary athletic showcase. It didn't matter that Poland's and Russia's best walkers could cover the 50K 20 minutes faster than Al ever had. It was good to want something that much. It made him feel alive. He was surer than ever in 2002 after his father, eager to be closer to his son, paid for Al to take a four-day course called Landmark Forum, a '90s incarnation of the est self-empowerment workshops that swept the nation in the '70s. Al loved it. Landmark, he told people, made him understand the reason that he hadn't made the 2000 Olympics: He hadn't wanted it badly enough. He hugged his dad, who flew from the East Coast to attend Al's "graduation," and he crowed, "Dad, you gave me life twice!"
Nothing could stop him now that he'd been given the green light to want even more than he'd wanted before. Not the hernia surgery in 2003. Not the decline in his performances that meant he had to give up his dorm room at the Olympic Training Center. Not a new wave of depression that began to devour him, no matter how many times he was reminded that he could keep training, working and eating at the center. Not the nights when the Prozac he took to combat the depression, possibly triggering a manic reaction, made him more hyperactive than ever, kept him up dialing friends across the world, playing video games and cleaning out his closet.
He flew to Maine to improve his custom-made walking shoes, added yoga to his regimen of walking, weightlifting and swimming. He swore off women. He vowed that he was going to bring his splintered family together in Athens. He made a sign and taped it dead center in the bathroom mirror of the condo his parents helped him buy in Chula Vista:
NOBODY WANTS IT MORE THAN ME
ATHENS 2004
He stopped taking Prozac. An Olympian couldn't possibly need such a crutch, and besides, the quest killed sadness better than any drug could. "It's just situational depression," he told people. "I'm fine now.... My life is like a fairy tale now."
He affixed a second sign to his wall -- there's no 'i' in team, but there is in iraq -- because if he didn't make the four-hour Olympic qualifying time, he'd likely lose his place in the World Class Athlete Program and might end up being reassigned anywhere.
He rose at a meeting of the track and field athletes at the training center, wearing the athens 2004 sweatshirt he'd bought a year before the Games. The speech he delivered might set off alarms in other settings, but in this one it lit a blaze. "The Olympics are a precious, precious opportunity," he cried. "I'm serious as a heart attack!... It's a fragile opportunity, and you've got to make sure you're doing everything" -- his fist pounded a table -- "every goddam thing you can do to put yourself in the best position to make that team.... But it's not good enough to make the team! That's why I brought this freakin' sweatshirt! My goal is not to make the team, my goal is to contend for a medal! If you guys can't see that, if you guys don't want to contend for a medal, then you guys shouldn't be here! I don't even know if I'm gonna make the team! There may be a monsoon again! I hope to God I do, but I may not. But I swear to God, if I make it, I'm fightin' for my country." His fist pumped. The Olympic hopefuls whooped. "I'm going to the goddam Olympics because I'm gonna try to win a medal! And I'm gonna freakin' die rather than lose!"
Al began to slow. Had he failed to take enough liquids and carbohydrate gels, underestimated the effect of temperatures climbing from the 40s into the 60s on a course with no shade? Or was he just recovering for a kilometer or two, girding for the home stretch?
Al slowed even more. On came Curt, chewing at the gap. On came Tim, catching a second wind and deciding to go for it all. By the 34th kilometer, it was written all over Al's flesh: He'd miscalculated. At 35K, Curt and Tim went by him as if Al were planted in the asphalt.
The world around him began to whirl. He crept the next five kilometers, and then the horror of 2000 flashed before his vacant eyes. Philip, seemingly out of the race minutes earlier, stormed past him into third place ... again. "C'mon, Al, go with me," Philip implored, his heart aching this time for Al. But Al couldn't. No one, until afterward, would realize how much pressure he'd heaped on himself, how much energy had been consumed by the Olympic flame that burned within him.
Curt won in 3:58:24, the only walker to slip in under four hours and qualify for Athens. Then came Tim, Philip, Sean ... and finally Al, staggering home fifth in 4:23:52, bending over at the finish line, being kissed on the back by a race official whose heart was broken too, then staggering into a blanket that someone held open for him, sagging onto a stretcher, trembling with dehydration and disbelief that his dream had slipped away again.
Yes, Al, Yes. You still have a shot, a helluva shot, everyone at the training center reminded him. There's the World Cup in Germany in May, and if you don't get your four-hour race there, then Wisconsin-Parkside will hold a 50K and you can try again. There are still two slots open, Al! Keep your chin up! You can still go to Athens!
Al nodded, said little. He didn't tell them that there was nothing left inside him, nothing left at all. Everyone was relieved that he didn't seem quite as distraught as he had been in 2000.
His father encouraged him all he could, then left California and flew back home two days after the race. His mother remained at his condo. On the third day, he mustered a smile as he headed out the door. "I'm going to train with Tim, Ma," he called. He met Tim at the Olympic Training Center dining hall for a breakfast with California congressman Randy (Duke) Cunningham and Olympic candidates who'd received federal scholarship money to attend college and graduate classes.
The congressman had heard about the race. He rose and told a story of a silver dollar his father had given him to keep in his pocket as a reminder never to give up, and how that coin and his father's admonition had helped him survive a drill sergeant who took him to his breaking point at flight training school in Pensacola, Fla., and later during harrowing moments as a fighter pilot over Vietnam. He concluded by rolling silver dollars across the table to Al and Tim.
"That's for you to keep," said Cunningham, "to remind you, the way my silver dollar from my father did for me, never to give up."
Who knows what that silver dollar meant to Al? He left the dining hall with it, ran an easy three kilometers with Tim and 20K race walker John Nunn, then said goodbye to them and Coach Pe�a. It was 11 a.m. He climbed into his SUV and departed.
No one knows what filled those next eight hours. He exchanged a series of calls with his mother, promising to pick up her cousin in San Diego that evening so the three of them could eat together at seven. At 5 p.m. he told his mother he had to stop at the airport and pick up a friend. Instead he drove toward the mountains. There was a place he remembered.
A light mist fell. He neared Pine Valley, the gorge 45 minutes west of San Diego that he and the other walkers had hiked down three months earlier. His mother called at 6:50 wondering what had become of him. "Sorry, Ma, the weather's bad, my friend's plane's late," Al lied.
"Please, Al, my cousin's waiting," she protested. "Can't you find someone else to wait for your friend?"
For the first time, she heard an odd ring to his reply. "Uh ... I'll try," he said. She called again six minutes later. The cellphone, lying near his wallet, rang again and again in his car.
Al began to walk across the bridge. Cars hissed past him on the wet asphalt. Dusk pooled in the gorge below. He stopped not even a third of the way across. He wouldn't need all 450 feet.
Now that the flame was out, the rules made no sense. He looked over the railing. The emptiness went on and on. Both feet left the ground.

First Major Achievement
The big breakthrough in McIlroy’s career came in 2011 when he landed the US Open at Bethesda, Maryland, crushing the field by securing an 8 stroke victory over Australia’s Jason Day. It had been a tremendous response from McIlroy after a crushing blow at the 2011 US Masters.
McIlroy had the title in his grasp only to throw it away. Leading by four strokes at the start of play on the final day, everyone was expecting McIlroy to claim his first Major title then. But a shocking round of 80 left him reeling down in T15 at the finish. However, the record was finally set straight for him at the US Open, setting a new aggregate score record at the event, on his way to a storming victory.
Career Successes
McIlroy won the second Major title of his career when he took the PGA Championship title in 2012, helping him to finish the year top of the US PGA Money List. During a remarkable 2012, where he committed his time mostly to the US PGA Tour, McIlroy became the first ever European to pick up four PGA titles in a season. Prior to that, only Tiger Woods had managed to win five events in a single season.
McIlroy was also successful in the 2012 Race to Dubai, the European money list. Wins at the BMW Masters and the Barclays Singapore Open, in some stunning end of season form, saw him round off things by winning the season finale at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai as well. Claiming both the US and European money list titles in the same year, he emulated what Luke Donald had achieved for the first time in golf history, the previous year.
McIlroy was awarded the PGA Player of the Year, the PGA Tour Player of the Year and the European Tour Golfer of the Year in 2012. The Northern Irish star collected an MBE from the Queen in the 2012 New Year Honours List from the Queen.

Robert Griffin III’s knee surgery rehabilitation has been shrouded in secrecy
Video: The Post Sports Live crew discusses whether Robert Griffin III is overexposed nationally with appearances at the White House correspondents’ dinner after parties, ESPYs and movie premieres.
May 19, 2013 05:59 PM EDT
The Washington Post
E-mail the writer
The story of Robert Griffin III ’s rehabilitation from January knee surgery has trickled out in occasional tweets and texts, in vague proclamations from the Washington Redskins and Griffin’s doctor of the quarterback’s ahead-of-schedule progress, and in sporadic interviews.
With the midpoint between Griffin’s Jan. 9 surgery and the Redskins’ Sept. 9 regular season opener at FedEx Field having passed earlier this month, however, the condition of Griffin’s body and mind remains unknown, at least to those outside his inner circle.

Full coverage of Robert Griffin III
A living archive of everything the Washington Post has published on Robert Griffin III — blog posts, articles, columns, photos and video.
“Physically and mentally, he’s doing as well as he always has, because of his attitude,” Griffin’s mother, Jacqueline, said in a telephone interview last week. “He’s doing great. He knows that his surgery was a success and he’s ahead of schedule, and he’s looking forward to the upcoming season. Nothing has changed, really. We’ve always had a positive outlook, no matter what happens.”
As the Redskins prepare for the first full-squad workouts of 2013, which begin Monday at Redskins Park in Ashburn, the mystery surrounding Griffin’s condition may soon be over. Members of the media will be permitted to view parts of those workouts Thursday, and while Griffin is not expected to be involved in offensive drills, he will perform his daily workout routine with team trainers and other rehabbing teammates.
That same day, Griffin is expected to address as a whole the media who cover the Redskins for the first time since Jan. 6, when he was injured during the fourth quarter of the team’s 24-14 loss to Seattle in the first round of the NFC playoffs. It was later revealed that he tore the lateral collateral ligament in his right knee, and three days later in Gulf Breeze, Fla., surgeons — overseen by James Andrews, a Redskins team orthopedist — also repaired a torn meniscus and revised the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that was first surgically repaired in 2009.
The injury, which occurred when Griffin remained in the Seahawks game despite visual evidence that his injured knee was deteriorating, set off a firestorm of criticism and debate over whether Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan, or perhaps Griffin himself, should have removed the quarterback from the game sooner.
In the more than four months since, Griffin’s media availability has been limited to a handful of cursory group interviews, a sit-down interview with the in-house “Redskins Nation” that primarily rehashed the 2012 season and an ESPN The Magazine cover story .
In March, Griffin sent a cryptic text message to an ESPN host in which he said, “I know where my responsibility is within the dilemma that led to me having surgery to repair my knee and all parties involved know their responsibilities as well.” Efforts to engage Griffin in an elaboration of that statement have been unsuccessful.
“I don’t feel like playing against the Seahawks was a mistake,” Griffin said in the ESPN story. “But I see the mistake in it. With what happened and how everything was running — you take me out. If that happened again next year, I’d come out of the game and sit until I was 100 percent healthy.”

An American state championship match between Irmo and Lexington is likely to go viral after the game ended with a bizarre penalty.
High-schoolers from Irmo and Lexington faced off on Saturday night in the South Carolina Class AAAA state championship match, and after 110 minutes of goalless football the game headed to penalty kicks.
After 9 penalties the score was 3-3, and it was up to Irmo's Mattison Gossett to take the potentially match winning spot-kick.
Gossett aimed his penalty to the right of Lexington keeper Jacob Parton, but incredibly the goalie guessed the right direction and saved the shot at first instance. Then came the craziness.
As goalie Parton began celebrating his save with a couple of hops on his goalline, the ball amazingly spun into the net for to earn Irmo the 4-3 shootout win.
After a weak protest that the goal shouldn't have stood, poor teenage goalie Jacob Parton was left distraught in his goalmouth as his broke down in tears. As for Lexington, their squad flooded the pitch as wild celebrations ensued.

Lids, a store that sells sport, fashion and collegiate hats,  started carrying merchandise with the Charlotte Hornets logo a year ago and according to store manager, Adrian Splawn, "They sell very well." MELISSA MELVIN-RODRIGUEZ - mrodriguez@charlotteobserver.com
Sorensen: Shinn took Charlotte to stars with Hornets
The Charlotte Bobcats are on their way to becoming the Charlotte Hornets.
The Bobcats have started pursuing a name change to Charlottes original NBA team, an informed source confirmed to the Observer. Though the Bobcats will need permission from the league to make such a change, incoming NBA commissioner Adam Silver has twice indicated that shouldnt be a problem.
Whats still in question is when the name change could be implemented and how extensively the Bobcats would assume the Hornets old look. The source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, would not comment on whether the popular teal-and-purple color scheme would return to Charlotte.
The Hornets were Charlottes first major-league team, and for most of 14 years the town embraced the team. The consecutive sellout streak for home games reached 364, nearly nine full seasons.
Players like Muggsy Bogues and Dell Curry still live here and are still prominent figures. The Hornets drafted power forward Larry Johnson and center Alonzo Mourning with top-two picks and they led the team to an unlikely victory over the Boston Celtics in a first-ever playoff appearance in 1993.
But even before then the Hornets owned the town. They lost their first home game by 40 points to the Cleveland Cavaliers, yet received a standing ovation following that game. Despite going 20-62 that first season, the Hornets were featured in an uptown parade. Years later Mourning, Johnson and Bogues were pictured on a mural across a wall of one of Charlottes bank towers.
A generation raised on the Hornets kept wearing the teal-and-purple gear after the team left town, and started lobbying for a switch back to the old name and logos over the internet. The campaign came to be known as Bring Back the Buzz and has several thousand followers on Facebook.
Any change probably couldnt be implemented before the 2014-15 season. Silver said last month during a trip to Charlotte that it would take a minimum of 18 months to rebrand an NBA franchise. The leagues uniform-maker, Adidas, and other licensees need that much lead time to produce branded merchandise.
The Bobcats have estimated it would cost them about $3 million to rebrand because so much signage and other logo material would have to be replaced. Sources indicate both Bobcats owner Michael Jordan and outgoing NBA commissioner David Stern advocated a switch to the Hornets to better market Charlottes team.
CBSsports.com first reported Friday night that the Bobcats have started applying for various rights on the Hornets name the New Orleans franchise recently discarded to become the Pelicans. The Pelicans decision opened the door to this move.
While the nostalgia associated with the Hornets could give the Bobcats a pop, it wont count for much if they continue to struggle on the court. The Bobcats have gone a league-worst 28-120 in games over the past two seasons.
There is enough nostalgia about that name that they could get some good karma from it, Columbia sports-marketing professor Joe Favorito said in December. Would they stick around if the team isnt good? Probably not. But that nickname could have the effect of getting some customers to give it a second look.
Silver has said a name change to Charlotte Hornets is somewhat streamlined because the league already owns rights. But the Bobcats still must go through an approval process with the league, then work through all the logistical issues involved in rebranding.
A dispute over the suitability of the Charlotte Coliseum (which had only a handful of luxury suites) caused then-owners George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge to apply for relocation to New Orleans.
The NBA eventually granted the Hornets permission to move in 2002, but simultaneously began negotiations to replace them in Charlotte with an expansion team. That team, awarded to Bob Johnson, was named the Bobcats with an orange-and-blue color scheme.
That name never caught on with Charlotteans. After annually losing millions, Johnson sold majority control of the Bobcats to Jordan in March of 2010. Jordan, who had been a minority owner since 2006, has often said his goal is to recreate the atmosphere he experienced playing against the Hornets in the 1990s.   
The prospect of Charlotte getting back the nickname and logo became easier when New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson bought the Hornets and immediately indicated he wanted a nickname more associated with Louisiana. Over the winter, the NBA signed off on a change to the Pelicans.

You know. Ferrer just did something that was seemingly impossible here. Not only he returned the second smash, he also created an unbelievable shot that Nadal was not expecting at all. So Rafa was﻿ thinking, "he is so far back, I will just use the drop shot" but by the time he did it, David "teleported" there and won the point.

Help pro wrestler Zema Ion with his medical expenses so he can continue performing for all of his fans!
Michael Paris (Zema Ion of TNA Wrestling) was recently rushed to the hospital and unexpectedly diagnosed with an appendicitis. While examining his condition through cat scans, doctors discovered that the 26-year-old also has a 5 cm tumor located on his colon. While we are currently waiting for the biopsy results to determine whether or not the tumor is cancerous, Paris will soon have to undergo another surgery to remove it. In the meantime, we are trying to fight for a way to afford to keep him healthy and pay his growing medical expenses. Paris does not have health insurance, so the costs for these surgeries and hospital stays are going to be extremely expensive for him. Please help us to afford this effort and pitch in any way possible!   Michael Paris is a recent graduate of West Virginia University and the oldest of three children raised by their single mother, who came to the US as a mail order bride from the Philippines. Paris began chasing his lifelong dream of becoming a professional wrestler at age 16, and after 9 years of hard work, he was signed to a contract with TNA Wrestling in 2011. Paris can currently be seen on TNA's television show, Impact Wrestling, which airs Thursday nights on Spike TV. We are asking friends, family, fans and people of the community to reach out and help in any way possible, so he can afford the medical help necessary to get him back on his feet, back in the ring and healthy again. Thank you and God bless.

MANHATTAN, Kan. — With a 6-5 walk-off victory against No. 19 Oklahoma on Friday night, Kansas State secured the program’s first Big 12 baseball regular season championship. The 18th-ranked Wildcats (38-15, 15-7) have not won a conference championship since 1933 when K-State tied for first in the Big Six.
K-State secures the No. 1 seed at next week’s Big 12 Baseball Championship a year after entering the postseason event as a No. 8 seed. Kansas State was picked to finish seventh in the league in this year’s Big 12 coaches’ preseason poll.
OU, which was selected as the preseason favorite, led the ‘Cats 4-0 through six innings. K-State cut the lead to one with three runs in the sixth and then chased Sooner ace and top prospect Jonathan Gray with a single run in the seventh to tie the game at 4-4. A Jon Davis triple followed by a Lance Miles pinch-hit single gave Kansas State the lead in the bottom of the eighth, but OU’s Jack Mayfield quickly tied the game with a solo home run in the ninth. Kansas State responded by loading the bases in the top of the ninth and win on a wild pitch, 6-5.
This marks the second time a Big 12 member has claimed regular season crowns in football, men’s basketball and baseball in the same year. Texas accomplished the feat during the 2005-06 season when the Longhorns won the Big 12 football south division title, shared men’s basketball with Kansas, and were the outright winners in baseball.
Kansas State cracked the top 25 in four polls this past Monday, ranking as high as 18th by Collegiate Baseball. Kansas State leads the Big 12 in eight offensive categories, including batting average, hits and runs.
With the win, the Wildcats set a school record for conference victories. K-State’s overall win total of 38 is five shy of the school-record 43-win season of 2009. The previous best finish for Kansas State in the Big 12 standings was third place in 2010.
The Wildcats are led by head coach Brad Hill, who is in his 10th season at the helm, and has led his team to the NCAA postseason in three of the past four seasons.
This also marks just the second time the regular season crown has been claimed by a Big 12 program not based in Texas. Former member Nebraska is the only other league team outside the state of Texas that accomplished the feat. Previous regular season champions include Texas (2002, ‘04, ‘06-’07, ‘09-’11), Texas A&M (1998-’99, 2008, ‘11), Baylor (2000, ‘05, ‘12), Nebraska (2001, ‘03, ‘05) and Texas Tech (1997).
The 2013 Big 12 Baseball Championship is slated for May 22, through May 26, at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City.

Warriors come back onto court to thank Oracle Arena fans after losing to Spurs (Video)
Tweet
0
The Golden State Warriors ' season came to an end Thursday, as the San Antonio Spurs scored a 94-82 Game 6 win behind a balanced attack that saw all five Spurs starters finish in double-figures, led by Tim Duncan 's 19 points, with Manu Ginobili (11 assists, six rebounds) and Gary Neal (eight points, five boards) offering key contributions off the bench. After finishing off a 4-2 win in their best-of-seven semifinals series , the Spurs now advance to a Western Conference finals tilt with the Memphis Grizzlies , which Duncan told Yahoo! Sports NBA columnist Marc J. Spears is "not going to be pretty."
While the Spurs move on, the Warriors head home. Things didn't end the way they'd hoped — the Spurs defense again preventing the duo of Stephen Curry (22 points on 25 shots) Klay Thompson (10 points on 12 shots) from getting loose, an ankle injury severely hampering Andrew Bogut's influence on both ends of the floor, a very scary fall keeping rookie Harrison Barnes from finishing the game — but the Oracle Arena faithful appreciated the effort Mark Jackson's squad put into producing the team's best season in years ... and they stayed well after the buzzer, cheering and chanting to make sure the Warriors knew how they felt.
They got the message, and came back out to the court to let the fans know the feeling was mutual.
"We just want to thank you guys for your continued support all season," Curry said, as the crowd raised its collective voice. "You guys made Oracle Arena a great place to play. The energy, the passion you have for us ... it's unmatched across the league, so we want to just thank you guys. Obviously, it didn't end the way we wanted it to, but all the hard work and the foundation we built this year, we're going to keep growing and get back to this level next year."
Getting back to that level will be difficult — the Western Conference is always so competitive and Golden State's salary structure suggests they might have a difficult time making significant moves and additions in the offseason, meaning they're going to need sustained health and continued progression from the young core of Curry, Thompson and Barnes to reach new heights and attempt to advance beyond "feel-good story" status to the level of true championship contenders.
Those are issues for the days ahead, though. Thursday was about celebrating the journey, the fans who made it possible and the players who gave Jackson everything, as Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News wrote :
“Sometimes one of the best statements you can make is fight,” coach Mark Jackson said. “At the end of the day, our tank will be empty and our light will be bright.
“I truly believe that’s exactly what took place. Guys battled, guys gave me everything they had. We fought and I could not be prouder of any group.”
That pride shone through in the postgame dress of point guard Jarrett Jack, who chipped in 15 points off the bench and did his level best to handle more of the playmaking duties against a swarming Spurs defense with Curry limited by ankle pain over the last several games. "On the verge of tears" at his locker after the game, Jack — who now enters free agency — spoke with Marcus Thompson of the Bay Area News Group about a quiet decision that spoke volumes:
[...] He couldn’t find the words to truly express what he was feeling, so he let his attire do the talking for him.
JACK: “Usually before I would do any media, I would make sure I was dressed a certain way. I brought one of my best suits. But looking down at this jersey, it’s just a sense of pride I don’t think I’ve ever felt as a professional. … Nothing in my closet is better than what I have on now.”

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — New York Jets running back Mike Goodson is facing drug and weapons charges after he was found in a car with an acquaintance early Friday morning on Interstate 80 in New Jersey.
According to state police, Goodson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by 31-year-old Garant Evans of Roselle. After receiving a 911 call from a tow-truck driver at about 3:15 a.m., police found them stopped in the left-center lane of Interstate 80 west in Denville, about 25 miles west of New York City.
State Police Sgt. Adam Grossman said both men were charged with marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and weapons offenses stemming from a 45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, that included a hollow-point bullet, found in the vehicle. Grossman wouldn't say whether either man was the registered owner of the gun.
Evans also was charged with DWI, several traffic violations and possession of a weapon with a prior felony.
Goodson was evaluated at a hospital in Denville and released into police custody, Grossman said.
Both men were being held Friday pending transfer to the Morris County jail, Evans on $150,000 bail and Goodson on $50,000 bail. It wasn't immediately known when they were scheduled to appear in court.
"This is a pending legal matter," a Jets spokesman said. "There will be no further comment until the legal process has run its course."
The 25-year-old Goodson, from Spring, Texas, played three seasons for Carolina and one for Oakland before the Jets signed him to a three-year, $6.9 million deal, which includes a $1 million signing bonus, in March.
Goodson was drafted by the Panthers in the fourth round out of Texas A&M and has played in 40 games in the NFL, rushing for 722 yards and three touchdowns on 160 carries. He also has 59 receptions for 524 yards and a score.
He spent last season with Oakland as a backup to Darren McFadden, and ran for 221 yards and caught 16 passes for 195 yards last season. Goodson was expected to compete for playing time with Chris Ivory, Bilal Powell and Joe McKnight, and was brought in to be an asset in new offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg's West Coast system because of his speed and ability to catch the ball out of the backfield.
Two weeks ago, the Jets cut defensive end Claude Davis and cornerback Cliff Harris a day after they were arrested and charged with marijuana possession in Morristown, several miles from where Goodson was arrested.

Planes, trains, and automobiles. Hitchhiking, buses, and — depending on who you ask — even stagecoaches. That's how NBA players traveled when chartered flights were little more than a big-market luxury. Back then, you had to get to blips on the map like Fort Wayne and Rochester. Red Auerbach used to tell his storied Boston Celtics "Every man for himself" as he leapt onto the last seat of a departing train during a snowstorm. "It was much easier to play the games than to get there," Celtics legend Bob Cousy said in a phone interview. "There were always problems." Just getting there was half the battle. And sometimes the battle was lost.
Born of an idea from a recent Bill Simmons column that placed the Miami Heat's 27-game win streak in context with the legendary 1971-72 Lakers, I checked in with some NBA legends on their most memorable travel (mis)adventures. "When you're 25 years old, you kind of go with the flow," said Dolph Schayes, a Hall of Famer who played for the Syracuse Nationals and Philadelphia 76ers. "But that's the way it was. By today's standards, it's the Stone Age."
By Air
Gail Goodrich (Los Angeles Lakers, 1965-68; Phoenix Suns, 1968-70; Lakers, 1970-76;  New Orleans Jazz, 1976-79): We traveled coach. You'd go to the airport, you meet up, you get tickets, you go on the plane, you wait. There's delays. When you went east from Los Angeles, you always had the snowstorms. The biggest things were the three nights in a row. We would play on Friday in Los Angeles, get up Saturday morning and travel to Phoenix, Portland, or Seattle, and then play Saturday night. We'd stay overnight, get up early Sunday morning, fly back to Los Angeles, and play Sunday night. That would be a West Coast [trip], three games in a row. And when we traveled east, it was not uncommon to play four games in five nights.
I remember one trip early in my career, there was a snowstorm in New York and we were coming from Los Angeles. We had to land in Toledo, spend the night there, then get up the next morning and take a train to New York. We got there an hour before game time and played that night.
Now they go commercial and probably don't even touch their bags. We had to carry our own bags — not only that, but if you were a rookie, you had to carry the bag of balls. You had to take six balls to practice and pregame then. And then, Elgin [Baylor] had his hydrocollator for his knees. If you're a rookie, you had to carry that as well. We had two rookies, so one of us carried the hydrocollator. One of us carried the practice balls. We'd check them. You'd get it at baggage claim, then you'd  be responsible for it — take it to the hotel, take it to the trainer. You'd give it to the trainer at the hotel or you'd be responsible to take it to the game. 1
Dolph Schayes (Syracuse Nationals/Philadelphia 76ers, 1949-64): I remember specifically a game where we flew back in a snowstorm. It was in the late '50s. We played mostly on Saturday nights and we had to play in Syracuse for one of the early-era television games at one o'clock or something like that. We had to get back and a big snowstorm came from the west. We had a couple of guys who hated to fly. One of them was named Connie Dierking, who had played at the University of Cincinnati. He hated to fly. Hated it. The pilot said, "Well, we're going to fly, but we're kind of flying in the teeth of this blizzard coming in, so for navigation, we're going to follow the Mass Turnpike. We won't be flying too high." So Connie's groaning, saying, "Oh my God." It was very bumpy and Johnny Kerr, who was a jokester, he kept things light. He said, "Connie, what are you worried about? More people die in automobile accidents and crossing the street. Planes are very, very safe, the safest of all transportation. In fact, the other day, there was a train crash in France where 90 people died." Connie said, "Really, what happened?" Johnny said, "Oh, a plane fell on the train." I thought that was really funny at the time. To make a long story short, we got back. 2
Bob Cousy (Boston Celtics, 1950-63, 1969-70): We didn't have any near-death experiences. Those things [Douglas DC-3s] were the safest planes ever made at the time. Our trainer, though, he had an upset stomach and he'd be filling one of those burp bags just walking up the steps to the damn plane. You'd get turbulence just getting up to whatever altitude you were going to fly in, and then of course flying during the wintertime was the worst conditions. We used to slap him in a seat and play gin rummy. While he threw up, we used to win his money in cards.
Elgin Baylor (Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers, 1958-72): [One day in 1960] we left Minneapolis in the afternoon. Before [we took off], the pilot told us that he was having problems with something. [Midflight] both of the engines cut off. Just cut off. I think he thought that he was running out of fuel and he said they have to go down. The whole time they were circling, trying to find an airport or something like that. We went down and he told everybody to brace themselves.
Rod Hundley (Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers, 1957-63): Nobody was hurt on that deal. A miracle. The only guy who missed it was Rudy LaRusso. He played ball at Dartmouth. He had an ulcer back in Minneapolis, so he missed the flight. It almost went from the Lakers to a Laker. They were flying the plane around and trying to decide what to do with it. We only had a certain amount of fuel left and the pilots left it up to us. "What do you want to do? We've got about 25, maybe 30 minutes of gasoline left in the plane. It's up to you guys. Otherwise, we've got to take the plane in right now. That's our choice." We said, "Let's go now." We got in the position. We all said, "Look, if you can get it on the ground, let's go that way." That's the thing that we did. They flew the plane with the windows open. One open on the right, one open on the left, which is the way a DC-3 plane is built. What they were doing was looking out the window the whole flight and they flashed a flashlight and were pointing at downtown and trying to get some help, so we could get back to Minneapolis. Elgin went and laid down in the back of the plane.
They had to take the plane around once or twice to bring the plane in. We almost hit a car coming down. The story gets bigger and bigger. We take the plane back up. That really throws you back. I thought, This is it. We're done. They got it back up where they could get enough leverage to make a landing and they brought it back in. What we didn't know is they were trying to dig snow up and get us a place to land. We went into a cornfield and that knocked down a bunch of stalks. But it helped to slow down the plane. When we hit, we were just trying to stay on the ground and you could feel the plane hitting the cornstalks. That was the big cornstalk field there in that city. It worked. But it came down and hit, then it went back in the air about three or four times. It was like taking a basketball and flipping it up in the air and letting it go, boom, boom, boom, boom, until the ball stops. That's the way it was. So when we came down, the plane bounced five or six times. It was a hard landing, but a good one. Finally we came to a stop and everybody was looking at each other. We didn't know what had happened. Everybody was just in awe on the ground. Then all of a sudden, everybody started yelling like we had won a game that night. Everybody was slapping each other on the back. Then, they had to open the back for us to get off the plane, and we were in three feet of snow. Guys were making snowballs and hitting each other. We were so happy to be alive. There was a motel there pretty close. We had a big cup of coffee. Everybody had a room to themselves. But nobody wanted to go to bed. Everybody wanted to stay up and talk and drink coffee and have doughnuts. We had made it. The weather was perfect when we woke up the next morning.
Baylor: It was fine, but it was scary, heck. Everybody was scared at one point in time. I know people were scared because we had Jim Krebs. He's since passed away, [but] Jim always thought the worst. Nice guy, but you heard him saying, "Oh, we're going to crash."
I'll tell you what's funny: After we landed, who was waiting for the plane to hit anything, the plane to flip or whatever, just waiting there for us? After the smoothest landing ever, we hear a knock on the door. We come to find out the person that's knocking on the door — you could hear him saying, "Is everybody OK?" — was the town mortician. What happened, we were circling overhead and he was the one who called the highway police and told them somebody was in trouble. In fact, when we traveled to the hotel, we went in one of his funeral cars. It was so late, we couldn't get cabs to take us. We went the rest of the way [to Minneapolis] by train.
Jerry West (Los Angeles Lakers, 1960-74): [Travel] was just a constant hassle, to be honest with you. You got used to it: the lack of sleep, catching the first available flight out, any mechanical issues. There was one incident in Chicago during the streak [of 33 consecutive wins during the '71-'72 season] and we didn't get to Philadelphia until 5 a.m. because of travel. That was a particularly bad game. We didn't start the game out very well, but we ended it well. There are just so many times that you have little or no control over travel.
I remember we got stuck in Buffalo one time for about three days. There was a blizzard up there and we couldn't get out. It's not the greatest place in the world to [be caught] in a blizzard, and being confined to the hotel, you couldn't leave. But there were so many other numerous ones, playing a Saturday-night game in Los Angeles and then flying to New York overnight and playing the first game of a doubleheader and then playing a Sunday-afternoon game in Boston Garden. It happened frequently to us.
Trying to sleep, that was always the big issue with me. Some people can get on an airplane and sleep. I couldn't sleep on planes. I couldn't sleep after games. There were tons of games you'd play with four or five hours' sleep, and that's why it was so important to be able to get there with plenty of time to take a nap or something. That was part of the routine I had, to be able to play at a level that I wanted to play at.

Nate Thurmond (San Francisco/Golden State Warriors, 1963-74; Chicago Bulls, 1974-75; Cleveland Cavaliers, 1975-77): When I first started playing, I was on the same team with Wilt. That meant that Wilt got the best seat for the tall people and I was fourth in line because we had Wayne Hightower and Tom Meschery, who had been there before me. They were both tall guys. The veterans got the bulkheads. Wilt got the aisle, whatever side he wanted. What you had to do as a rookie was try to find a seat where nobody was in front of you. They give you an assigned seat, you wait until everybody was on the plane. You look around, find a seat where nobody was sitting, and get the seat behind that and push that seat up in front of you. That was the trick to it. Being that I was the tallest rookie, I usually made out by going that route.
We went on trips that were for 19 days, 14 days. You have to remember that there were only two teams on the West Coast: Los Angeles and San Francisco. The next stop was St. Louis. And then you look up and flight canceled, flight delayed. And you're sitting in the airport tired as heck and making sure you have your suit bag and waiting for whatever happens, waiting on a plane and getting there three hours before game time or whatever.
When they traded Wilt my second year, I went to the owner and I said, "I would like to have Wilt's room." Wilt was the only one that had a single room. I was one of the few guys on the team that was a bachelor. And he granted me Wilt's room. I don't know how I would have done it. I [roomed with] guys who couldn't wait to turn on the soap operas. I never watched soaps in my life. When I got my single room, that was a big happening for me. No question about it.
Jerry Sloan (Baltimore Bullets, 1965-66; Chicago Bulls, 1966-76): One of the things I remember is we played five games in five nights in five cities. We started off in Baltimore, St. Louis, Los Angeles, I believe, and San Francisco, and from San Francisco back to New York.
There was another time, we essentially had to take a bus from Buffalo, New York, to Chicago and play in Chicago and then had to go back to Boston. The planes weren't flying because of the weather. They got a bus and made a stop in Cleveland, Ohio. We got into Chicago at five or six in the morning, maybe later than that. I believe we had the day off, then had to play and go back to Boston. That was the first time we were ever on national TV, against the Celtics. We played a good first half, but they waxed us the second half. There was more to that. I can't get it straight, but it was a pretty rough trip.
The thing that happened to me is, I took the job at Evansville. I was only there for five days and then the guy who replaced me was killed in a plane crash with all the players. I don't talk too much about that anymore. It's something I kind of stay away from.
Satch Sanders (Boston Celtics, 1960-73): When we played against Cincinnati, there was a charter flight involved and both teams flew on the same charter. It was an experience. There was one group in the back, another group in the front. Or vice versa, considering how we were traveling, depending on who sits where. It wasn't a big deal. We were all on the same plane. But that was one series. That was a DC-3. You could probably drive to those locations faster than that plane would travel.
Rod Thorn (Baltimore Bullets, 1963-64; Detroit Pistons, 1964-65; St. Louis Hawks, 1965-67; Seattle SuperSonics, 1967-71): Of course you didn't have to go through the screening that you go through now. You could just go to the airport and get up at 4:30 in the morning to make a six o'clock flight.
Earl Monroe (Baltimore Bullets, 1967-71; Knicks, 1971-80): In Baltimore, we always took what we called the secondary airlines: North Central, Allegheny, airlines like that. Piedmont, I used to say their motto was "We never lose sight of the ground." These airlines, you get up in the air and there's so much turbulence. We used to come from Baltimore to New York, and of course, the cab drivers were so crazy coming through New York once you got off the flight. It was a hectic time leaving Baltimore coming to New York.
I remember one time on North Central Airlines, we were going to Cincinnati and the window blew out and everything started going swish, swish, and we put a piece of board up at the window to keep everything in. It finally made it down while the guy was holding this thing, and we had to change flights. It might have been one of my teammates holding the board, because there wasn't a lot of attendants on the flight. It was a small flight. Obviously, we didn't like to travel on those small airlines. As a matter of fact, a guy named Leroy Ellis, we were coming from an exhibition game down south, and he didn't want to travel with Piedmont. He rented a car and drove back to Baltimore. Those airlines with all the turbulence and whatnot kept us on edge.
Walt "Clyde" Frazier (New York Knicks, 1967-77; Cleveland Cavaliers, 1977-80): You got used to [waking up for early flights]. I didn't realize until I got to Cleveland how spoiled I was. There, you had to get up every morning and connect through Chicago. You always had a 7:30 flight because you couldn't fly direct anywhere. But with the Knicks, we used to charter, too. We were one of the few teams back then that used to charter. We might play Friday night in Chicago, Saturday in New York, and charter back, especially late in the season before the playoffs. A lot of teams weren't making enough money, so they couldn't do that. 3
Stu Lantz (San Diego/Houston Rockets, 1968-72; Detroit Pistons, 1972-74; New Orleans Jazz, 1974; Lakers, 1974-76): Back then, you had to leave the morning after the game. You never left the evening after a game. We're in New York and there's a snowstorm. We're on the runway for approximately four hours or more, waiting for it to clear up. We get to Atlanta and they actually had to delay the game for about a half an hour. By the time we got to Atlanta, we had to go straight from the airport to the arena for the game.
Jim Barnett (Boston Celtics, 1966-67; San Diego Rockets, 1967-70; Portland Trail Blazers, 1970-71; Golden State Warriors, 1971-74; New Orleans Jazz, 1974-75; New York Knicks, 1975-76; Philadelphia 76ers, 1977): We just accepted it. I remember even playing with the Warriors, now this was in the '70s. We played in Houston. That game, we got up and then we had a game in Chicago that night and it was one of those rare times we flew out, and then we played in New York, so we flew from Chicago that night into New York. So the bottom line is, let's just say it was a Tuesday. Tuesday night, we'd play in Houston. I woke up Wednesday morning in a bed in Houston, flew to Chicago, checked into a hotel. Got a couple hours' sleep in the afternoon, took our bags with us to the game, played the game that night, and then flew to New York. So that night, we slept in New York. Woke up in Houston, slept in the afternoon in Chicago, and went to sleep in New York that night.
Bill Fitch (coach, Cavaliers, 1970-79; Boston Celtics, 1979-83; Houston Rockets, 1983-88; New Jersey Nets, 1989-92; Los Angeles Clippers, 1994-98): It's a long-lost subject right now when you figure how easy it is to play the game, take a shower, get on the airplane, and go home or go to your next destination. That makes quite a difference. Here's the example: Playing in New York, you got to go out to Chicago and play the next night. You've got to catch the first flight available out in the morning, so that's around 6 a.m. and you're flying, you've got your two centers sitting wherever they seat them with their knees up over their heads. You look back and there's a crying baby and your point guard is sitting right next to him and you figure, we've got to play tonight against [Tom] Boerwinkle, [Bob] Love, [Chet] Walker and company. That was the way it was back all through the '70s.
When they talk about back-to-backs now, it's a lot different than when you have to play a back-to-back and you have to catch the first available flight out the next day and go commercial and you don't have assigned seating, and even if you do get first-class seats, there weren't enough to take care of your whole ball club. Some of the best card games played were playing for those guys that were under 6-foot-4. If there were a couple vacant seats, they could play a poker game for who was going to get them.
By Land
Schayes: When the BAA [Basketball Association of America] merged with the National League in 1949, there were a lot of small, Midwestern towns. Each team played each other once that year, the BAA teams and the old National League. So the Sheboygan Red Skins come into New York to play the Knicks. It's not bad enough that on the marquee of Madison Square Garden, it says Knicks versus Sheboygan. But at eight o'clock for an 8:30 game, up comes two station wagons. That's how the Sheboygan Red Skins got to New York, and right in front of the Garden as everybody's coming in, these guys came out with their bags and played the game. And I think [Knicks owner] Ned Irish told the owners, "We've got to be more big-time." The next year, they dumped all of those Midwestern teams.
Tommy Heinsohn (Boston Celtics, 1956-65): You couldn't get to Fort Wayne from Rochester back then. If you were going to play one night in Rochester and you tried to play in Fort Wayne, you couldn't get there. There was no train that would stop in Fort Wayne. There was no plane that would get you there through connections. The only way that you could get there was to take a train, but it stopped about 20 miles short of Fort Wayne. It stopped in the middle of a cornfield. Then you had to walk to the middle of this town and you had to stand in front of the Green Parrot Inn and thumb a ride from some high school kid and give him $10 to take you to Fort Wayne.

Al Attles (Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, 1960-71): I remember we had to bus down [during a playoff series] with the other team and they had beat us and we had to come from Syracuse and go back to Philadelphia. I don't think there was a lot of love lost on that bus. You couldn't fly with those small planes. That's why we had to take a bus from Syracuse. It was the playoffs and the airport was shut down. We were playing the next night in Philadelphia, so we had to get back to Philadelphia. They hired one bus, both teams got on the bus. Unfortunately for us, we lost the game. So Syracuse got on the bus before we did, and Wilt gets on the bus and there are no good seats left. What he wants to do is sit in the last aisle. Swede Halbrook had that seat. He was 7-foot something. Wilt wanted that seat and they got on the bus before we did, so there was a little confrontation on the bus. Plus, we lost the game, so we weren't real thrilled about it anyways. Wilt said, "When I get on the bus, that's my seat." But it was just the way it was. You played and just got on the bus and ready for the next game.
Frazier: We were always in coach, or on buses. There was no luxury, that's for sure. The only luxury we had were with buses. I think we were the first team to use a bus to go to the game. When I first came in they were renting cars, and then sometimes the guys didn't show up with the car, people were late, and then we started using, like, the city bus to go to the games. We had to clean our own road uniforms. It was very offensive. Sometimes I would forget and it would be like cardboard. That [combined with] where we stayed — you're talking about Holiday Inns back then.
West: One time, we were in Cincinnati. There was a major snowstorm and they woke us up before we even went to bed and said we had to go get on the train and get to Chicago and play a game that afternoon. A Saturday-night game in Cincinnati and a Sunday-afternoon game in Chicago. We got on the train. We dressed on the train, stepped in [puddled] water after the rainfall with our uniforms on, and played in the old place there.
Roommates and Teammates
Sanders: If there was a problem, the other roommate had to make sure the luggage got downstairs and to the airport. If you were late, they had to make sure your stuff got there. We were responsible for each other. There were some difficulties. Everyone talks about how difficult it was. There were also tremendous advantages. The biggest advantages were the fact that we were together, that we had roommates. If you begin to contrast that to what the young men are learning now, they aren't really learning that much about human relationships. They of course each get a room of their own. The advantage, of course, was learning how to live with another person and dealing with the ups and the downs and learning about the likes and dislikes of another human being.
Barnett: We were around each other more then, and I remember outbursts in airports and things like that. I think nerves were a little more frayed. I remember one with Elvin Hayes and myself.  He and I didn't get along very well. He didn't get along with too many people, quite frankly. In Milwaukee, he got mad with me about something and started chasing me around the airport, but couldn't catch me. I ran and ran and ran and got to the taxi and went to the hotel. That day, we had an afternoon game. We were playing Milwaukee with, at that time, Lew Alcindor. It was going to be Elvin Hayes against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and it was a nationally televised game. He was really pissed and this was how it carried over: Jack McMahon was our coach, and he really liked me. We're in the locker room before the game and I figured Elvin wouldn't start something then with everybody around. We're all dressed and now it's about a half-hour before game time, and Elvin is still sitting over there in his street clothes and Jack tells Elvin, "We go on the floor in about 10 minutes. You better get dressed." He said, "I no play." That's exactly how he said it, because he didn't use verbs all the time. Jack asked if he was hurt, and he said no. Elvin looked at me and said, "He play?" Jack said, "Yeah. Jim is starting. He's going to guard Oscar [Robertson]." Elvin said, "That man play. I no play." Jack took me outside the locker room and said, "OK, tell me what happened." I told him what happened and he said, "Listen, I'm not telling you what to do, but Bob Breitbard, our owner, if he had to get rid of somebody, we know it's not going to be Elvin." He led the league in scoring that year. He said, "If somebody has to go, it's going to be you. And I know you love San Diego. Do what you want to do, though." So I went in there and apologized and said, "OK, Elvin, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for what I said last night." Everything's cool and we got dressed and I remember one of the first plays of the game, I kind of threw a behind-the-back pass on a fast break to him and he went right down the middle and dunked, and that made him happy all the time and we were fine.
On top of all that, we stayed in crappy hotels. If we stayed in a Holiday Inn, we were overjoyed. But we stayed in crummy places. I think meal money was $10 a day when I first came into the league. My entire career, we always had roommates and most of the time, twin beds. I spent three years with the Warriors and my best friend and roommate, Clyde Lee, from Vanderbilt, he's 6-foot-10. He used to put suitcases at the end of his bed and put the blankets over that to have a little bit of extra room.
Part of an extension of the NBA then was going out and drinking beers afterward, and Jack McMahon would go out and drink right with us. He got upset if we ever didn't hook up with him. He'd say, "You guys ditched me last night. Where did you go?" But he was our 39-year-old coach and he was a friend. He would try to fix you up with women on the road. That was part of it. I remember driving into a hotel at three in the morning. In Cincinnati, the players rented cars, and I remember bringing back some lady to the hotel. Jack came in at the same time. We came in parallel. Jack's in one car and I'm in the other. We looked across at each other and he looked up and gave me the fist shake. He was happy for me. And we had a game the next night somewhere.
Heinsohn: Once, we went to L.A. and were going to play the Lakers and pulled in at around 2 a.m. We were supposed to have rooms reserved for us, but there weren't enough rooms. Carl Braun, who had been an All-Star with the New York Knicks and was one of Red Auerbach's pickups at the end of his career to help us, didn't have a roommate. I was his roommate and they tripled me up. They put us triple in the rooms because there weren't enough rooms, and there wasn't a triple for him. They said, "What are you going to do with Carl Braun?" The manager says, "All I can think of is we'll put a cot in the grand ballroom and the first available room, we'll give him in the morning." At 7:30 the next morning, Carl Braun wakes up in the ballroom in the middle of a Communion breakfast.
Red Auerbach
Sanders: Auerbach was Auerbach. Once, we were in Philadelphia and we had to get to Boston during a snowstorm, an incredible snowstorm. We had to get there to play against Syracuse. Syracuse was already there waiting for us. They had not played the night before and we were sort of stuck in Philadelphia. Auerbach called all of us together, and while he was talking to us the train was loading right behind us. He brought us all to one side and he started going into this long speech and he kept looking over his shoulder. He said, "You guys better make sure you're there on time. We've got an afternoon game and you better get your asses in gear." As he backed away, he yelled out, "Every man for himself!" And he leaped onto the train. The train couldn't take any more passengers and he had already spoken to the conductor, who knew who Auerbach was. So Auerbach had a spot on the train. We asked if we could get on the train. They said, "No, there's no room on the train." And Auerbach was smiling as he was leaving. We had to rent cars. A couple guys had friends that would drive with them to Boston or to New York and they would get a bus or rent a car from New York. But we had to find a way to get there for the afternoon game against Syracuse.
Another time, we were coming in to land and we were in crosswinds. The pilot was trying to get into wherever we were. He said, "Look, we've got a real problem. There are 45 mph crosswinds and it's going to force us to come in very hard. I'm not going to be in full control of the plane, but we think we can make it." He tells us this over the system. And he says for everybody to get into the crash position. All of a sudden, you hear Auerbach yelling. He yells, "Help me, somebody. I can't bend that low in a crash position." Yelling and we're trying to make jokes about it. But of course no one can get up and move to help him. He's yelling. Just screaming at the top of his lungs. The plane is all over the place. You know [the pilot is] descending. We obviously made it. But we had Auerbach screaming to laugh about for a long time.
Cousy: As I'm sure you heard, [Red] could be a bit of a pain in the ass at times. It used to be funny because four of us would jump in a cab together — you had to go three or four to a cab. And if you had a rookie, you'd try to get a rookie to go in the cab with you, because when the cab got to the airport or the hotel, the minute the cab driver stopped, all of us would pile out. We'd try to get the rookie in the middle and pile out of both doors. We'd pop the hood of the truck, grab our bags, and sprint into the hotel. We'd leave the rookie to pay for the taxi because Auerbach was such a pain in the tail about giving you back expenses. He'd always give you a hard time about it. Cab drivers must have thought we were out of our minds, these four adults in a cab, he gets to the destination and we all run like banshees out of the cab with one poor guy there left to pay. We'd always pay, but normally you'd try to stick the rookie because Arnold was so difficult to get reimbursement back.
Barnett: We always flew in from Boston when we played New York or Baltimore and we always flew the day of the game. We did not fly the day before if it was an off day, because it saved on the hotel bill and we would get day rates. We'd get in at noon and we stayed in the hotel room for about three hours, then we'd go to the game. So we got a day rate like a prostitute would at a hotel. I remember coming into LaGuardia, New York, it used to cost about $6 for the cab. It used to be John Havlicek, Satch Sanders, and myself. I was a rookie. I had to pay the cab and it was like six bucks and one time I gave the cabby a dollar tip. Red Auerbach bit my head off for tipping too much. I had to get the money back. So the next time in, I remember the ride was $5.50 or something. I gave him 50 cents and the cabbie took the two quarters and threw them out on the sidewalk of New York. He said, "A 50-cent tip for four guys?" But Auerbach had intimidated me.
Heinsohn: Nobody wanted to pay expenses going from the airport to the hotel or train station to the hotel. So, if there was a rookie on the team and he was in the cab, he would pay and in the lobby, you would go see Red as soon as you got to the hotel and be reimbursed. If one person's cab fare was $3.50 and somebody else's was $4, everyone would get $3.50. So, nobody wanted to pay the cab. I ended up in a cab once with no rookies. When that happened, it was usually the guy whose suitcase was in the bottom of the trunk who would end up paying the cab. We're in Philadelphia and I get in the cab and my bag is on the top. So I don't think I'm going to pay the cab and badger Red to get paid for the expenses. They open the trunk to get the suitcases and Frank Ramsey's bag was on the bottom. Ramsey ripped his out while I'm bending down to get mine, and the corner of his suitcase hit me right between the eyes, knocked me out, and everybody walked to the hotel. The cab driver said, "Who's paying for the ride?" They looked at me and said, "When he wakes up, he'll pay."

Sandwiched in between Fernando Torres and David Luiz in the medal procession was 11-year-old Liverpool fan Louis Kearns, who had travelled to the game with his dad and somehow ended up shaking UEFA president Michel Platini's hand in front of millions of TV viewers. The BBC reports:.
It is understood Chelsea FC has no idea how he gained access to the team.
Louis' aunt Francesca Kearns, 28, said: "I was watching the game, but I wasn't paying much attention to it. I've then seen a blond boy walk past the screen and I said 'I'm sure that's our Louis'".
"We were just laughing about it as he seems to get himself everywhere. As Torres went up to get his medal, he was waiting behind him and we realised it was him."
Louis was away from his father for "no longer than five or ten minutes" and was in sight of him at all times.
Louis' aunt explained that the Liverpool-loving youngster was a huge fan of Fernando Torres, and seized an opportunity to slip onto the pitch to get his photo taken with the Spaniard. One thing led to another and he ended up climbing the steps behind his idol.
A UEFA spokesman said Louis was "quietly removed" when he was spotted on the ceremony tribune, which is an extremely sinister way of saying someone with a headset yanked him away when he was trying to snuggle between Lamps and Luiz...

Dick Trickle was One of a Kind, a Genuine Talent, and One of the Legendary Drivers in Racing History
While He Didn't Win at NASCAR's Cup Level, Trickle's Skill was Undeniable, and He was a Great Guy Who Will Be Missed by All Who Had the Privilege of Meeting Him
Tweet
0
COMMENTARY | My memory of the first time I met Dick Trickle is one I'll never forget.
It was the late 1990s, he was driving the No. 90 Heilig-Meyers Ford for Junie Donlavey in the then-Winston Cup series, and was making an appearance to sign autographs at his team's hauler at the track one afternoon.
When I approached him, he quickly struck a friendly tone with me and my friend. Conversation flowed for a minute, and then we decided to ask him a simple question before getting the autographs: What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?
See, Trickle was famous not just for his unique name, or his hundreds of short-track wins, but also for smoking cigarettes in his car during caution periods.
In true Dick Trickle form, he slyly replied to us in a lowered tone: "Don't tell NASCAR, but I smoke Marlboros. I just keep them in a Winston box."
That's Dick Trickle in a nutshell to me.
He lived life as he wanted, didn't bow to anyone's will or expectations of him, and had a lot of fun along the way as he chased his racing dreams ... which is why what happened Thursday in a cemetery in North Carolina is too tragic for words, as it appears Trickle took his life in a very public way at the age of 71, calling the police and telling them they would find his body at the cemetery when they arrived. Only he knows why he did that, and all I can say is rest in peace, sir, you will be missed. My thoughts are with his family as they deal with the aftermath of his passing.
A racer's racer
Dick Trickle was what folks call a racer's racer.
He could go flat-out fast, especially on a short track. He won so many races that nobody knows exactly how many he won (estimates range from hundreds to over 1,000; records weren't kept as good in the days he was racking up all those wins).
It took a while to lure him to NASCAR, as he could make more money racing several times a week on the short tracks than he could just racing Sundays in NASCAR.
Rusty Wallace was one of the people who was most stunned by Thursday's news, as he credits Trickle for helping him become the championship racer he became.
"I'm in 100 percent shock. Dick Trickle was my mentor," Wallace said in a statement on Thursday. "When I was short track racing, I would call him every Monday morning and he would always help me with race setups and stuff. He and I had such a good time telling little stories, but he was the guy that taught me almost everything in the American Speed Association. And he was the guy that I battled right to the end for my 1983 ASA championship. I barely beat the guy that taught me everything. I'd not seen Dick as much as I'd like to of late. He was a legend. A man that ... was a role model to many short track racers coming up. Could just do magic with the race car and he taught me so much about racing. My success in the ASA and what Trickle taught me is what got me into NASCAR. That's what got me hired by Cliff Stewart back in '84. Between Larry Phillips and Dick Trickle, they taught me everything."
That kind of praise wasn't unique, as everyone on Twitter had their Trickle story to tell, and even younger drivers paid their respects.
- "Dick Trickle taught me to be me, He taught me to Justify things my way and said "Kenny keep laughing loud cause that's who you are," wrote Kenny Wallace.
- "Sad to hear of Dick Trickle. At some point we were all short trackers. He was the best. #RIPDickTrickle," tweeted Joey Logano.
And so on, and so on. Those who knew the man well enjoyed being around him. And those who didn't know him respected him and what he could do in a racecar. When Trickle finally chose to go the NASCAR route full-time in 1989, he was 47 years old and took home Rookie of the Year that season. Fun fact: Trickle's first NASCAR start was in 1970 at Daytona , nearly 20 years before he decided to go full-time. His final Cup race came in 2002 at the age of 60.
A career to be proud of
Dick Trickle would go on to win a couple Busch series races late in his career, but never did much of note in a Cup car (15 top-5 finishes and zero wins over 303 races) due to inferior equipment. But that does not diminish what he accomplished in a racecar over his many decades of racing.
Go ahead and ask any of the drivers competing in the top NASCAR series today if they'd be happy with the career of a short-track legend like Trickle, and you can bet they'd all say yes. Because that's where almost all of them came from in the first place, and they can marvel at what he was able to accomplish on that stage -- which may be smaller than the big lights of NASCAR, but is often an even tougher venue to go out and win -- with so many hungry young drivers looking to get their big break and willing to wreck you to get it.
His ending may be tragic, but his life was far from that, and that's what I'll remember when I think of Dick Trickle. He's a reminder that we should live our lives as we choose to live them, and have some fun along the way.
Guys like him are the backbone of racing, must moreso than the glitz and glamour of the Cup series, and that won't change no matter how big NASCAR gets.
So again, rest in peace Dick Trickle. You will never be forgotten.

The Bruins just have too much depth... the Rangers were tired as hell and got dominated in OT.
Lundquist played very well. But that sort of goal -- if the defender is unable to break up/deflect that cross-ice pass -- is one of the hardest saves to make in the NHL.
Patrice Bergeron's pass could not have been more on the mark. He led Marchand perfectly while avoiding the backchecker's stick. Just another example of why he is one of the﻿ NHL's most under-rated players, his all around game rocks!!

26.1223-80.1434
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A warrant has been issued for the arrest of former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson in South Florida.
The state attorney's office confirmed Thursday that a Broward circuit judge issued a warrant May 7 against Johnson for failing to report to his probation officer.
Johnson received a year of probation last September after pleading no contest to a domestic violence charge involving his former wife, reality TV star Evelyn Lozada.
The six-time Pro Bowl player was arrested in August after Lozada said he head-butted her during an argument. She quickly filed for divorce, which was finalized days before his conviction. They had only been married since July 4.
Johnson was cut by the Miami Dolphins shortly afterward. He previously played for the Cincinnati Bengals and New England Patriots.
Lozada is on the "Basketball Wives" TV show.

The University of Memphis baseball team plays its final home game of the season Tuesday. In addition to rooting for the players, Memphis fans will cheer for someone else: batboy Stan Bronson Jr.
But "boy" is a relative term. Bronson is 84, and this year he celebrates his 55th year in the honorary position with the University of Memphis Tigers. The game's announcer, Jeff Brightwell, calls him a "living legend," and he's been recognized by Guinness World Records as the " most durable batboy " in baseball history. At the end of the seventh inning of each home game, Bronson stands on home plate, tips his hat and takes a bow.
'Don't Need Money. Need A Job'
Bronson, who has an intellectual disability and a speech impediment, says he was fired from the athletic department at Rhodes College before he came to the University of Memphis. "They didn't like my attitude," he says.
Bronson's mother brought her son to the University of Memphis in 1958. As Bob Winn, the university's associate athletic director, recalls, the pair spoke with football coach Billy "Spook" Murphy.
"Coach Murphy said, 'Well, son, I'm sorry but I don't have money in my budget to pay for anybody else.' And Stan said, 'Don't need money. Need a job,' " Winn says.
Bronson has been a campus favorite since his arrival. These days, he doesn't chase after foul balls or grab bats as much as he used to. But he does have a special seat right on the field, next to the dugout. Game announcer Jeff Brightwell says even if the team is losing, fans stick around in the seventh inning.
Bronson is renowned for ending the seventh inning of every home game with a hat tip and a bow.

"You always want to see Stan come out and tip his cap," Brightwell says. "He is probably one of the most recognizable figures, which Stan's got to be on that Mount Rushmore of university athletics. Everyone knows and loves Stan."
Just as everyone in Memphis seems to have an Elvis story, many have a Stan Bronson story. Fans give him rides; others take him to dinner. Even the team's coach chauffeurs him around town.
"He's an icon of this institution," says Eddie Cantler, who was Memphis' athletic trainer for 35 years. "Stan is everything that is innocent and pure. And that's what he is. From the president on down, everybody knows that Stan is one of us."
Concerns About Future Medical Needs
Bronson has outlived most of his family. When his mother died, she left a trust and house for her son. But with the rising cost of repairs, the university recently moved him into an independent living community overlooking the campus. The school also unofficially oversees his care. Bronson has a lifetime pass to the university cafeteria, and the athletic training staff tends to his basic medical needs.
But there are growing concerns. Bronson has never collected a paycheck and is not eligible for Social Security, disability or Medicare. In 2012, Bronson's annual birthday party doubled as a fundraiser to offset future medical costs.
"We're very fortunate that Stan hasn't had any major medical problems," says Beverly Dunn, who put together Bronson's application for most durable batboy for Guinness World Records. "Stan doesn't take any kind of medicine. In a way, he's kind of a medical miracle for his age."
Bronson holds the record for batboy longevity, but he was never expected to live even a quarter of his current age. "We think, really, quite frankly, that athletics has kept Stan alive and going," says Winn.
From the sidelines, Bronson can see his retired jersey in right field. But he's not done yet. He plans to be right back in this same spot next year.

http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9282841/former-nba-union-head-files-suit-derek-fisher|Print
Ousted NBA players' association executive director Billy Hunter alleges in a lawsuit that president Derek Fisher had a secret deal with owners during the 2011 lockout that benefited himself, his publicist and certain players.
Hunter contends that Fisher undermined Hunter's efforts to make an agreement and interfered with his position by secretly negotiating with select owners in violation of union bylaws.
Filed Thursday in California Superior Court, the suit seeks unspecified damages for defamation and breach of contract. It also names the National Basketball Players Association and Jamie Wior, Fisher's publicist, and says Fisher and Wior worked after the lockout ended "to terminate his employment without cause and in violation of his contract."
"Wior harbored aspirations to assume a position of responsibility with the NBPA," the suit says. "She set out to craft a new public persona for Fisher, taking control of his media appearances and public statements and encouraging him to overreach his authority."
Hunter was ousted in February after an investigation into his business practices that found no illegal conduct but cited several conflicts of interest, questionable business decisions and hiring practices. Fisher finished the season with the Oklahoma City Thunder .
"It's unfortunate that I must take this action against an organization where I had the privilege of working with many dedicated associates over 17 years," Hunter said in a statement. "I'm proud of our record of achievement on behalf of players during my tenure as Executive Director and will continue to stand up for their interests. But I cannot let stand attacks on my character or accept what has been done."
The suit says owners were aided by Fisher when they locked out players in July 2011 after the expiration of the last collective bargaining agreement. It says the veteran guard realized he could have been on his last contract as a player, so he wanted to secure a "soft landing" after his career by keeping good relations with the league and team owners, even while Hunter was committed to a firm stance.
"Unbeknownst to Hunter, however, Fisher was secretly negotiating with the Certain Owners -- on his own and without any authority -- to settle the negotiations on terms less favorable to the players," the suit says.
"The NBPA's Constitution and By-Laws vest in Hunter the sole right to conduct collective bargaining negotiations on behalf of the Union. Fisher's interference in the negotiations exceeded his authority and undermined the Union's negotiating power. Wior's interference was completely without authority or basis. Ultimately, the players accepted a new CBA that left them with a greatly reduced share of the NBA's revenues."
The lockout ended in November 2011 with players' receiving a 50-50 split of basketball-related income, after they were guaranteed 57 percent in the previous deal. The relationship between Hunter and Fisher at times seemed strained, with Fisher often speaking to reporters alone after bargaining sessions while Hunter left quickly.
Fisher said he had just learned of the lawsuit before meeting with reporters in Oklahoma City and didn't want to comment.
"Obviously in any type of legal situation, you have to be very careful about what you say. So, I guess at the appropriate time I'll be able to respond or make a statement," he said.
Wior and a union official didn't immediately return messages.
Hunter led the union since 1996 before he was voted out during the All-Star break with more than $10.5 million left on his contract.

One of the greatest memories of my life. The way that the camera was shaking when he was celebrating shows that even the camera man was going nuts! Miss him so much in the England team, despite all the off-the-pitch lifestyle the guy was an amazing player and will always be in my greatest ever England 11. Cheers Dave, the whole of England loves﻿ you : )

http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/20130516/david-beckham-retiring-psg.ap/?sct=hp_t2_a3&amp;eref=sihp|David Beckham joined Paris Saint-Germain in February and will retire after PSG's game on May 26.
AP
LONDON (AP) -- David Beckham is retiring from soccer, ending a career in which he became a global superstar who transcended the sport.
The 38-year-old Beckham, who recently won a league title in a fourth country with Paris Saint-Germain, said Thursday he will retire at the end of the season.
"I'm thankful to PSG for giving me the opportunity to continue but I feel now is the right time to finish my career, playing at the highest level,'' the former England captain said in a statement.
Beckham, whose forays into fashion and marriage to a pop star wife have made him a riveting international celebrity, has two more matches left at PSG against Brest on Saturday and at Lorient on May 26. He has been giving his salary to a children's charity.
Beckham started his career with Manchester United and also played for Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Galaxy, winning titles with all those clubs.
"If you had told me as a young boy I would have played for and won trophies with my boyhood club Manchester United, proudly captained and played for my country over one hundred times and lined up for some of the biggest clubs in the world, I would have told you it was a fantasy,'' Beckham said. "I'm fortunate to have realized those dreams.''
On the international stage, Beckham holds the England record for making 115 appearances as an outfield player for the national team.
"To this day, one of my proudest achievements is captaining my country,'' Beckham said. "I knew every time I wore the Three Lions shirt, I was not only following in a long line of great players, I was also representing every fan that cared passionately about their country.
"I'm honored to represent England both on and off the pitch.''
Beckham is now living in London with his wife Victoria, a former "Spice Girls'' singer, and their four children.
"I wouldn't have achieved what I have done today without my family. I'm grateful for my parents' sacrifice, which made me realize my dreams,'' he said. "I owe everything to Victoria and the kids, who have given me the inspiration and support to play at the highest level for such a long period.''
With United between 1992 and 2003, Beckham won six Premier League titles, the Champions League, two FA Cups and the Intercontinental Cup.
Beckham left United in 2003 shortly after manager Alex Ferguson accidentally struck Beckham's eye with a football boot. Ferguson announced his retirement from Manchester United last week.
Beckham spent four years in Madrid - winning the 2007 Spanish title before making the surprise move to Major League Soccer, where he won the title twice.
There were highs and lows in Beckham's international career. He was blamed for England's elimination from the 1998 World Cup for his petulant red card against Argentina, but scored the winning goal against the same team at the World Cup four years later.
Beckham responded to jeering at the 2000 European Championship with an obscene hand gesture to England fans, but was lauded by the same supporters little more than a year later when his last-minute free kick against Greece secured a place at the 2002 World Cup.
England dropped Beckham in August 2006 in an effort to renew the team with younger players after a quarterfinal exit at that year's World Cup. England coach Steve McClaren recalled him the following year after a poor run of form, and he returned for the remainder of England's unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 2008 European Championship.
His last England appearance came against Belarus in October 2009, and he missed the 2010 World Cup because of an Achilles injury. He still went to South Africa as part of Fabio Capello's backroom staff.
"I want to thank all my teammates, the great managers that I had the pleasure of learning from,'' Beckham said. "I also want to thank the fans who have all supported me and given me the strength to succeed.''
Beckham had already started planning for his post-playing career earlier in the season, becoming an ambassador for Chinese soccer.
"Nothing will ever completely replace playing the game I love, however I feel like I'm starting a new adventure and I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead,'' Beckham said. "I'm fortunate to have been given many opportunities throughout my career and now I feel it's my time to give back.''
Beckham played a key role in England's unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup ahead of the 2010 vote, and the English Football Association wants to utilize his influence and star power in the future.
"He is an iconic figure in the game and produced wonderful performances for his clubs, particularly Manchester United,'' FA chairman David Bernstein said. "When you look at his playing and work for England, no one would ever accuse him of being unpatriotic and not giving everything for his country.
"He is a real loss to the game and I am sure the FA will want to embrace him and to get him closely associated with the organization.''
Beckham's retirement comes a week after the 71-year-old Ferguson ended his managerial career.
"In the week following Sir Alex Ferguson retiring, which came as a bit of a shock, now we have the iconic David Beckham coming out of the game,'' Bernstein said. "It's unexpected even though he is getting to mature years for a footballer.''

Scientists Invent Particle That Lets You Live Without Breathing
​Scientists at the Boston Children's Hospital have invented microparticles that allow patients to live for 15 to 30 minutes without breathing, without risk of heart attack or brain damage. This technology will save millions and may be the greatest invention of our generation. Eventually people with complete respiratory failure will only have to worry about looking like a weirdo for not breathing, able to completely forget that they're defying death like a god.
The elixir carries 3 to 4 times as much oxygen as our own red blood cells.
Someday they'll sell this particle for recreational use: Divers will be able to go swimming without coming up for air in 30 minutes. Miners will be able to delve into mines without risk of black lung. Injections will regularly be included in first aid kits.
John Kheir, MD at the Department of Cardiology at Boston Children's Hospital said:
Some of the most convincing experiments were the early ones. We drew each other's blood, mixed it in a test tube with the microparticles, and watched blue blood turn immediately red, right before our eyes.

The technology could be used to check the vital signs for a newborn
Researchers develop paper-thin heart monitor
Tweet
Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford University , said he has developed a wearable heart monitor that is thinner than a dollar bill and no bigger than a stamp.
Bao and his team of engineers combined layers of flexible materials and pressure sensors to create the skin-like heart monitor. They claim that the device could be used to track heart health and give doctors a new alternative to check the vital signs for a newborn and high-risk surgery patients.
 Another application could be related with artificial skin. An artificial sense of touch could be generated by using many of these sensors on a prosthetic limb. “The pulse is related to the condition of the artery and the condition of the heart,” Bao explained. “The better the sensor, the better doctors can catch problems before they develop.”
To create the small and sensitive technology, Bao's team used a thin middle layer of rubber covered with tiny pyramid bumps. When pressure is put on the device, the pyramids deform slightly.
A heartbeat is comprised of 2 distinct peaks, but the device is so sensitive that it can detect more than two. "You can use the ratio of the two peaks to determine the stiffness of the artery, for example. If there is a change in the heart's condition, the wave pattern will change," researcher Gregor Schwartz explained.
The team is now working to make the device completely wireless, which would allow doctors to receive a patient’s minute-by-minute heart status through a smartphone and from anywhere.
“For some patients with a potential heart disease , wearing a bandage would allow them to constantly measure their heart’s condition,” Bao said. “This could be done without interfering with their daily life at all, since it really just requires wearing a small bandage.”

Toking up may help marijuana users to stay slim and lower their risk of developing diabetes, according to the latest study, which suggests that cannabis compounds may help in controlling blood sugar.
Although marijuana has a well-deserved reputation for increasing appetite via what stoners call “the munchies,” the new research  [PDF], which was published in the American Journal of Medicine, is not the first to find that the drug has a two-faced relationship to weight. Three prior studies have shown that marijuana users are less likely to be obese, have a lower risk for diabetes and have lower body mass index (BMI) measurements. And these trends occurred despite the fact that they seemed to take in more calories.
Why? “The most important finding is that current users of marijuana appeared to have better carbohydrate metabolism than non-users,” says Murray Mittleman, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study. “Their fasting insulin levels were lower, and they appeared to be less resistant to the insulin produced by their body to maintain a normal blood sugar level.”
The research included over 4,600 men and women participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2005 and 2010.  Among them, 48% had smoked marijuana at least once in their lives and 12% were current cannabis smokers. The authors controlled for other factors like age, sex, income, alcohol use, cigarette smoking and physical activity that could also affect diabetes risk.
Even after these adjustments, the current marijuana users showed fasting insulin levels that were 16% lower than those of former or never-users, along with a 17% reduction in another measure of insulin resistance as well. Higher levels on both tests are associated with Type II diabetes, which is linked with obesity. Marijuana users also had higher levels of HDL, the so-called “good” cholesterol, which can protect against heart disease. And the regular smokers also boasted smaller waistlines: on average, they were 1.5 inches slimmer than the former users and those who had never smoked cannabis.
Researchers don’t yet know how to explain these correlations — and since the study was not a controlled trial, it’s not clear whether marijuana or some other factor in marijuana users’ lifestyles actually accounted for the beneficial effects. Studies showed, however, that the cannabinoid brain receptors affected by marijuana are deeply involved in appetite and metabolism. But the exact details of how the compound alters the relationship between appetite, caloric intake and insulin response isn’t obvious yet.
One clue, however, may lie in the effects of a diet drug that was developed to have the opposite effect that marijuana has on the brain. That drug, rimonabant, produced significant weight loss and a drop in fasting insulin levels by affecting certain cannabinoid receptors in in the exact opposite way that THC, marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient, does.  This action is complex:  rimonabant doesn’t simply block the receptor and keep the natural cannabinoids from activating it.  Instead, while the natural cannabinoids elevate the normal level of activity already going on in the system; rimonabant lowers it so the result is precisely the reverse of activating the receptor naturally. However, due to psychiatric side effects like increasing suicide risk, rimonabant was pulled from the European market and never approved in the U.S.

How could both marijuana and a compound that has the the opposite effect of pot act on the same brain receptors and lead to weight loss? Natural marijuana includes many different potentially active compounds, and one of them— rather than THC— could be responsible for this effect.  One potential candidate is a substance called cannabidiol or CBD, which also affects cannabinoid receptors, but in a different way than THC or rimonabant does.
Another possibility involves tolerance: repeated use of a drug can make receptors less sensitive over time. “The most likely explanation is that prolonged cannabis use causes the [receptors] to lose sensitivity and become inactive,” says Daniele Piomelli, a professor of pharmacology at the University of California-Irvine, who was not associated with the new research, “This has been shown to happen in people who smoke marijuana. This weakening of the [these receptors] translates into a lower risk for obesity and diabetes because the inactive receptor would be unable to respond to our own cannabis-like molecules, which we know are important in keeping us chubby.” While marijuana may initially promote appetite and overeating, in the long run it has the opposite effect because it desensitizes cannabinoid receptors and may even protect against obesity.
So don’t skip the gym and break out the bong just yet: there’s still not enough data to tell whether marijuana, like alcohol, could have health benefits in moderation. Mittleman says that the study relied on self-reported use of marijuana, which can be unreliable. However, he points out that since people are more likely to hide drug use than they are to falsely claim it, the findings could even underestimate marijuana’s effects.
MORE:  Marijuana Slims? Why Pot Smokers Are Less Obese
But whether that’s true, and whether marijuana might be a window into understanding how to best control glucose and insulin to prevent diabetes, isn’t known yet. “It is much too early to say,” says Mittleman, “We need much more research to better understand the biologic responses to marijuana use. We really need more research to allow physicians and patients to make decisions based on solid evidence.” An editorial  [PDF] that accompanied the study also urged government action to reduce barriers to such research.
Even with 18 states now approving marijuana for medical uses, the politics of pot will always shadow research efforts to understand how cannabinoids work in the brain—or affect disease. But, as Piomelli says, “The [new] study suggests that smoking marijuana [may] protect people against obesity and diabetes.” And following up on that finding could yield new insights into how to tackle one of our biggest public health issues.

http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/news/records/2013/May/Child-maltreatment-adult-obesity.aspx|Child maltreatment increases risk of adult obesity
Posted on 21/05/2013
Children who have suffered maltreatment are 36% more likely to be obese in adulthood compared to non-maltreated children, according to a new study by King’s College London. The authors estimate that the prevention or effective treatment of 7 cases of child maltreatment could avoid 1 case of adult obesity.
The findings come from the combined analysis of data from 190,285 individuals from 41 studies worldwide, published this week in Molecular Psychiatry.
Severe childhood maltreatment (physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect) affects approximately 1 in 5 children (under 18) in the UK. In addition to the long-term mental health consequences of maltreatment, there is increasing evidence that child maltreatment may affect physical health.
Dr Andrea Danese , child and adolescent psychiatrist from King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry and lead author of the study says: “We found that being maltreated as a child significantly increased the risk of obesity in adult life. Prevention of child maltreatment remains paramount and our findings highlight the serious long-term health effects of these experiences.”
Although experimental studies in animal models have previously suggested that early life stress is associated with an increased risk of obesity, evidence from population studies has been inconsistent. This new study comprehensively assessed the evidence from all existing population studies to explore the potential sources of inconsistency.
In their meta-analysis, the authors were able to rule out specific factors which might explain the link – they found that childhood maltreatment was associated with adult obesity independently of the measures or definitions used for maltreatment or obesity, childhood or adult socio-economic status, current smoking, alcohol intake, or physical activity. Additionally, childhood maltreatment was not linked to obesity in children and adolescents, making it unlikely that the link was explained by reverse causality (i.e. children are maltreated because they were obese).
However, the analysis showed that when current depression was taken into account, the link between childhood maltreatment and adult obesity was no longer significant, suggesting that depression might help explain why some maltreated individuals become obese.
Previous studies offer possible biological explanations for this link. Maltreated individuals may eat more because of the effects of early life stress on areas of the developing brain linked to inhibition of feeding, or on hormones regulating appetite. Alternatively, maltreated individuals may burn fewer calories because of the effects of early life stress on the immune system leading to fatigue and reduced activity. The authors add that these hypotheses will need to be directly tested in future studies.
Dr Danese adds: “If the association is causal as suggested by animal studies, childhood maltreatment could be seen as a potentially modifiable risk factor for obesity - a health concern affecting one third of the population and often resistant to interventions.
He concludes:  “Additional research is needed to clarify if and how the effects of child maltreatment on obesity could be alleviated through interventions after maltreatment has occurred. Our next step will be to explore the mechanisms behind this link.”

http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/rightwhale_dtag|Study reveals how fishing gear can cause slow death of whales
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 21, 2013
(508) 289-3340
Using a “patient monitoring” device attached to a whale entangled in fishing gear, scientists showed for the first time how fishing lines changed a whale’s diving and swimming behavior. The monitoring revealed how fishing gear hinders whales’ ability to eat and migrate, depletes their energy as they drag gear for months or years, and can result in a slow death.
The scientists in this entanglement response suction-cupped a cellphone-size device called a Dtag to a two-year-old female North Atlantic right whale called Eg 3911. The Dtag, developed at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), recorded Eg 3911’s movements before, during, and after at-sea disentanglement operations.
Immediately after Eg 3911 was disentangled from most of the fishing gear, she swam faster, dove twice as deep, and for longer periods. The study, by scientists at WHOI, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and NOAA Fisheries, was published online May 21 in the journal Marine Mammal Science.
“The Dtag opened up a whole new world of Eg 3911’s life under water that otherwise we weren’t able to see,” said Julie van der Hoop, lead author of the study and a graduate student in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography.
North Atlantic right whales were nearly eradicated by whaling and remain endangered today, with a population of 450 to 500. About 75 percent bear scars of fishing lines that cut into their flesh.
Born in 2009, Eg 3911 was first sighted entangled and emaciated by an aerial survey team on Christmas Day 2010, near Jacksonville, Florida. Fishing gear was entangled around her mouth, wrapped around both pectoral fins, and trailed about 100 feet behind her tail.
Teams aboard boats attempted to cut away the fishing gear on Dec. 29 and 30, 2010, but were not successful because the whale was evasive. A multiagency team tried again on Jan. 15, 2011. First, they applied a Dtag. Then they administered a carefully calculated sedative with a dart gun developed for large whale drug delivery by Paxarms NZ in collaboration with Dr. Michael Moore, director of the Marine Mammal Center at WHOI and a marine mammal veterinarian. The becalmed whale allowed the team to approach and remove nearly all the fishing gear.
The Dtag measured 152 dives that Eg 3911 took over six hours. There were no significant differences in depth or duration of dives after sedation, but “the whale altered its behavior immediately following disentanglement,” the scientists reported. “The near-complete disentanglement of Eg 3911 resulted in significant increases in dive duration and depth.”
“Together, the effects of added buoyancy, added drag, and reduced swimming speed due to towing accessory gear pose many threats to entangled whales,” the scientists wrote. Buoyant gear may overwhelm animals’ ability to descend to depths to forage on preferred prey. Increased drag can reduce swimming speeds, delaying whales’ timely arrival to feeding or breeding grounds. “Most significant, however, is the energy drain associated with added drag,” they said.
To calculate that drain, the scientists, in a separate experiment, towed three types of fishing gear from a skiff, using tensiometers to measure the drag forces acting on Eg 3911. They then calculated how much more energy whales would require to compensate for the drag.  The results: Entangled whales have significantly higher energy demands, requiring 70 to 102 percent more power to swim at the same speed unentangled; or alternatively, they need to slow down their swimming speed by 16 to 20.5 percent.
The study provides the first data on the behavioral impacts of sedation and disentanglement and the energetic cost of entanglement in fishing gear due to drag.
On Feb. 1, 2011, an aerial survey observed Eg 3911 dead at sea.
“She didn’t make it,” van der Hoop said. The whale was towed ashore for a necropsy. “We showed up on the beach that night. I remember walking out there and seeing this huge whale, or what I thought was huge. She was only 10 meters long. She was only two years old. And all these people who had been involved in her life at some point, were there to learn from her what entanglement had caused.”
The necropsy showed that effects of the chronic entanglement were the cause of death.
“No fisherman wants to catch a whale, and I wish no fisherman a hungry day,” said Moore. “There needs to be a targeted assessment of how the fishery can still be profitable while deploying less gear so we can reduce the risk of marine mammals encountering fishing gear in the first place. At WHOI, we have hosted workshops talking with fisheries managers and fishermen about what might change so that they can continue to catch fish and stop catching whales.”
A dedicated network of scientists, veterinarians, and emergency responders support the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP), which was formally established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, is coordinated by NOAA Fisheries Service and coordinates the Atlantic Large Whale Entanglement Response Program.  WHOI scientists have been long-standing contributors to the MMHSRP and routinely participate in rescues for marine mammals that are stranded, injured or entangled.  Response efforts by the network for endangered species, such as North Atlantic right whales, are authorized by NOAA/NMFS Permit No. 932-1905-MA-009526 issued to the MMHSRP.    
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a private, non-profit organization on Cape Cod, Mass., dedicated to marine research, engineering, and higher education. Established in 1930 on a recommendation from the National Academy of Sciences, its primary mission is to understand the ocean and its interaction with the Earth as a whole, and to communicate a basic understanding of the ocean's role in the changing global environment.

Some things theoretical physicists study aren't true, but they help with reality.

Sarah Palin would hate Yang-Mills theory
I’m not a mathematician, however. I’m a physicist. I don’t study things merely because they are mathematically interesting. Given that, why do I (and many others) study theories that aren’t true?
Let me give you an analogy. Remember back in 2008, when Sarah Palin made fun of funding “ fruit fly research in France ?" Most people I know found that pretty ridiculous. After all, fruit flies are an iconic part of the popular image of biology, research animals that have been used for more than a century. And besides, hadn't we all grown up knowing about how they were used to discover HOX genes?
(Wait, you didn’t know about that? Evidently, you weren’t raised around biologists.)
HOX genes are how your body knows which body parts go where. When HOX genes are activated in an embryo, they control the fate of cells as they develop, telling them where the body’s arms and legs should go, what rib goes where, and so on.
Much of HOX genes’ power was first discovered in fruit flies. Because of the fruit flies' relatively simple genetics, scientists were able to manipulate the HOX genes , creating crazy frankenflies like Antennapedia. It was only later, as experimental techniques in biology got more sophisticated, that biologists began to track what HOX genes do in mammals (including humans). When they did, biologists made substantial progress in understanding debilitating mutations.
Thus, while “fruit fly research” might seem useless to Sarah Palin because it doesn’t study “important things” like human health, the chance to study a simpler system like the fruit fly allows scientists to learn a lot about properties generally applicable to many different organisms. In the end, this kind of research is a necessary first step to understanding the “real world” of humans.
In much the same way, N=4 super Yang-Mills is a simpler, more easily manipulated system that allows theoretical physicists to learn about the more complicated systems that describe the "real" physical world. Not only does it carry the advantage of every particle having the same mass and charge, it also has a property called "conformal symmetry."
In a theory with conformal symmetry, physics is the same no matter what scale you look at —whether you’re looking at events separated by light years over a period of centuries or only by nanometers and femtoseconds. If your theory is conformal, your predictions will be the same, regardless of scale. You can even use different scales in different places, warping your perspective, as long as you make sure that all angles remain the same. This means you can always write the answer to a problem in terms of angles with no mention of distances, letting you take powerful shortcuts in your calculations.
While N=4 super Yang-Mills shares the simplicity and ease of fruit fly manipulation, the analogy is a little more loose when it comes to connecting the theory to the real world. Fruit fly HOX genes tell us about human HOX genes because they are connected by our shared evolutionary heritage. Rather than one central principle like evolution, the links between N=4 super Yang-Mills and the rest of physics are many and varied. To illustrate this, let's consider a few examples.
Really helping reality
N=4 super Yang-Mills is linked to string theory in a number of ways; often this is a consequence of how the two theories are defined. As you are probably aware, string theory describes the world as a collection of ten dimensional string-like objects. Since the world that we are accustomed to has only four dimensions (three space and one time), the extra six dimensions must be curled up in some way so small that we can’t perceive them.
An important principle in string theory (inherited from general relativity) is the idea that space itself can be shaped in different ways, corresponding to different solutions of Einstein’s equations. Living on the surface of a sphere is very different from living on a flat sheet, no matter what coordinates you use. Similarly, living on a higher dimensional version of a sphere (called de Sitter space ) is very different from living in ordinary “flat” space. Because of this principle, different ways to curl up the six extra dimensions result in different apparent physics in the four dimensions of the “normal world.” If you want that “normal world” to look like N=4 super Yang-Mills, some forms of string theory make your job quite simple. Just make each of the six extra dimensions a circle!
AdS/CFT is another way that string theory can give rise to N=4 super Yang-Mills, through what is called the holographic principle. In the phrase AdS/CFT, CFT stands for conformal field theory (a theory with conformal symmetry, described above). AdS is short for anti de Sitter space. While de Sitter space is like a higher dimensional sphere, anti de Sitter space is the “opposite.” Cross-sections of a sphere look like circles, but cross-sections of anti de Sitter space are hyperbolas. This tends to make the full space somewhat tricky to visualize. (I’ve heard it described as being like a saddle, or like a sideways black hole, but honestly I don’t pretend to be able to picture the space in my head either.)
If you look at the boundary of an anti de Sitter space in string theory, you end up finding conformal symmetry, which gives rise to a conformal field theory. In particular, if the anti de Sitter space is five-dimensional (and the remaining five dimensions of string theory are curled up into a sphere), the theory that you find on the boundary is N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.
This is where the “hologram” in “holographic principle” comes in. It turns out that, in these cases, the boundary—the four dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills—has all the same information as the full, five dimensional space, just like a 2D hologram contains all the information for a 3D image.
Outside of string theory, similarities between formulas in N=4 super Yang-Mills and more realistic theories tend to show up unexpectedly. Often times they’re patterns that don’t yet have a clear explanation. This may seem surprising, but on a certain level this sort of thing is reasonable, as particle physics theories have very strict mathematical rules. There are only so many different formulas that can obey those rules, so we should expect nature to reuse them whenever possible.
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory (in the “theory of evolution” sense) of quarks and gluons, the particles that make up protons and neutrons. Calculations in QCD are much harder than comparable calculations in N=4 super Yang-Mills, but it turns out there is one part of both calculations that ends up exactly the same (the technical term for this part is the “ leading transcendentality ” piece). In a sense, this part is the most complex piece of a QCD formula, so understanding it sheds light on what might be called the “backbone” of the theory.
N=4 super Yang-Mills is also deeply connected to another theory called N=8 supergravity, an easier to manipulate form of gravity. (To put things into perspective, N=8 supergravity is related to gravity in the same way that N=4 super Yang-Mills is related to particle physics.) By arranging the results correctly, a calculation in N=4 super Yang-Mills can tell you the corresponding result in N=8 supergravity just by squaring the formula. Since calculations in gravity are generally much more complicated than in particle physics, this has greatly sped up progress in investigating N=8 supergravity. Further research has found that this relationship seems to apply to more real-world theories of gravity and particle physics as well.
Finally, the simplicity of N=4 super Yang-Mills makes it an ideal testing ground for some of the more ambitious and advanced methods of particle physics calculation. In quantum field theory, the precision with which we can predict something is described in units called loops, the values of which vary depending on the strength of the forces in question. The more loops you want, the harder the calculations become. The most accurate predictions in quantum field theory (and possibly in all of science) have been verified by experiments up to ten decimal places, and those predictions come from calculations done at four loops.
In N=4 super Yang-Mills it’s possible to do calculations up to six loops , and some specific results have been predicted up to an  arbitrarily high number of loops . The techniques required to get these results can often be generalized to real-world particle physics. These techniques give us an idea of what methods might be needed when the harder calculations of the real world catch up to the precision available in N=4 super Yang-Mills. Methods range from guessing parts of the result through something called a symbol  to constraining a solution by assembling pieces of it like a jigsaw puzzle.
The secret to good sushi: great rice
Got all that? Here's one more metaphor: according to Japanese tradition, an apprentice sushi chef spends the first five years without ever touching food. Once those five years are over, they are allowed to prepare rice. Only after they have mastered rice are they allowed to cut and clean fish.
The physics of the real world are more complicated than the most ornate sushi roll. We want to get things right, and for those who study N=4 super Yang-Mills, that means working with simpler theories. We're whetting our tools and sharpening our skills, making us better able to tackle those theories that are true. Like fruit flies in biology, N=4 super Yang-Mills allows physicists to do research that would be prohibitively difficult in more obviously relevant systems. In doing so, we can find the basic building blocks of particle physics, eventually advancing calculations in the whole field. And that is why I study a theory that isn't true.

Good news today for anyone planning to install renewable technology as the government role out a wave of new money in the form of increased grants.
Announced today by DECC, this will definitely tip the balance in the decision making by shortening the paybacl period for those investing in new renewable heating systems.
 
The full statement and comment by Minister Greg Barker reads:
Householders across Great Britain will be able to get even more cash for renewable heating kit, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has announced today.
The money off vouchers available under the Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) scheme have been increased to £2,300 for ground source heat pumps, £2,000 for biomass boilers, £1,300 for air source heat pumps and £600 for solar thermal systems.
The RHPP scheme, first launched in July 2011, is designed to encourage householders to switch to renewable heat from traditional heating systems by offering money off the cost of the equipment. The scheme is targeted at those living off the gas grid, where most money on bills and carbon can be saved.
Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker said:
“Over 10,000 householders have already taken advantage of money off renewable heating kit and we want to see even more consumers stepping up to the plate and getting on board.
“But I want to go even further. I want to kick start this exciting new market for consumer renewable heat technologies.
“This time limited, big increase in the value of vouchers for hardworking people who want to do something positive to install money saving green heating in their homes, should be a real boost for this growing green sector.”
The scheme was extended in March this year until the end of March 2014 ahead of the launch of a Renewable Heat Incentive for householders, with around £12million up for grabs.
Alongside changes to the voucher values, householders will now be required to undertake a Green Deal assessment before submitting a claim to the Energy Saving Trust to redeem their voucher. This will help householders think about how renewable heat could fit with energy efficiency improvements for their home and ensure they are advised on choosing the right technology for them. The additional voucher values are intended to reflect the cost of a Green Deal assessment, as well as the cost of getting these technologies installed in homes. Householders can also use the Green Deal to pay for some of the cost through savings on their energy bill.
The increased voucher values and Green Deal assessment requirement will kick in for any applications submitted today onwards.

May 21 (Reuters) - A new type of asthma drug meant to attack the underlying causes of the respiratory disease slashed episodes by 87 percent in a  mid-stage trial, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease, researchers said on Tuesday.
"Overall, these are the most exciting data we've seen in asthma in 20 years," said Dr. Sally Wenzel, lead investigator for the 104-patient study of dupilumab, an injectable treatment being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi.
The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as  improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists.
Although far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the "proof of concept" study, researchers expressed optimism. They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.
Results of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.
The medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.
"We have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn't get at the underlying causes," Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.
The drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).
HITS ELUSIVE TARGETS
Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.
The trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.
Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.
All patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.
Throughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.
After the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.
"By end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab," Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.
Wenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.
Regeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to  control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.
Dupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.
Atopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.
"This asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases," George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's research chief, said in an interview.
Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared "compelling" at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.
But the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a "limited subpopulation of patients with asthma" because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.
"We do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations," the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.

Bird's Playlist Could Signal Mental Strengths and Weaknesses
Male songbirds with the most songs aren't necessarily the smartest overall.

Noisy Environment Makes Young Songbirds Shuffle Their Tunes
Durham, NC - Having the biggest playlist doesn't make a male songbird the brainiest of the bunch, a new study shows.
"For songbirds, singing a lot of songs indicates a bird is smart, but that signal is not necessarily indicative of intelligence for everything," said Duke biologist Steve Nowicki.
In a series of problem-solving tests with the birds, he and his colleagues found that the male song sparrows that sang the most songs learned to solve food-finding puzzles more slowly than the birds singing fewer songs. The results are the first to show that a larger song repertoire links to cognitive deficits in other mental processes. 
The researchers think that female song sparrows may use potential mates' songs to gauge both mental strengths and weaknesses.
Since birdsong is a good model for studying speech development, the findings, published May 22 in Biology Letters , could also help neuroscientists better understand the trade-offs taking place as the human brain matures.
Nowicki and collaborators first measured the number of songs 14 male song sparrows sang. They then taught the birds to identify where a mealworm was hidden in one of 12 shallow wells on a wooden rectangle. The scientists put plastic caps over six wells so that the birds had to learn and remember spatially where the worm was on the wooden block. 
The birds that learned to solve the food puzzle more quickly sang fewer songs -- an observation opposite of what the scientists expected. 
"This study is very exciting," said University of Nevada-Reno biologist Vladimir Pravosudov, who was not involved in the study. "It is the first of its kind to show a negative correlation between song repertoire size and spatial memory in songbirds, and it goes against the grain of what many scientists had thought about the relationship between song and other cognitive abilities in birds."
Earlier studies with starlings had shown that the birds with larger playlists learned to solve spatial tasks more quickly. Other studies had also shown that a bird that sang more songs performed better on other cognitive tasks.
This newly discovered negative relationship between the number of songs a bird sings and speed of solving a spatial task suggests there is a trade-off between song learning and other cognitive abilities, Nowicki said.
He noted one caveat with the experiment -- the fact that song sparrows don't cache their food or migrate long distances. Both require advanced spatial learning and memory, but the ability isnât as important for sparrows as it is for blue jays and other species.
Still, the negative correlation suggests birds' brains may develop differently depending on how much effort is put toward learning songs or doing other mental tasks. Song learning happens in the HVC, the area of the bird's brain that controls song.  Spatial learning happens in the hippocampus. During development, more resources may go to one area or the other, giving an individual bird a strength in one cognitive ability and a weakness in the other, Nowicki said.
The study supports the idea of trade-offs in the development of the birds' brains. But, "this behavioral data is only tip of iceberg," Pravosudov said. Scientists will need to look at the structures, circuits and chemicals in the birds' brains to better understand mechanistically what the new results mean for brain development.
Nowicki agrees and said his team may perform those experiments next. If the work pans out, he added, scientists could one day use songbirds and birdsong to better understand how trade-offs in brain development influence behavior and cognition in humans too.

http://web.mit.edu/press/2013/a-new-way-to-open-clogged-arteries.html|For Immediate Release: May 21, 2013

Evaluating a new way to open clogged arteries
Computational model offers insight into mechanisms of drug-coated balloons.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Over the past few decades, scientists have developed many devices that can reopen clogged arteries, including angioplasty balloons and metallic stents. While generally effective, each of these treatments has drawbacks, including the risk of side effects.
A new study from MIT analyzes the potential usefulness of a new treatment that combines the benefits of angioplasty balloons and drug-releasing stents, but may pose fewer risks. With this new approach, a balloon is inflated in the artery for only a brief period, during which it releases a drug that prevents cells from accumulating and clogging the arteries over time.
While approved for limited use in Europe, these drug-coated balloons are still in development in the United States and have not received FDA approval. The MIT study, which models the behavior of the balloons, should help scientists optimize their performance and aid regulators in evaluating their effectiveness and safety.
“Until now, people who evaluate such technology could not distinguish hype from promise,” says Elazer Edelman, the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and senior author of the paper describing the study, which appeared online recently in the journal Circulation.
Lead author of the paper is Vijaya Kolachalama, a former MIT postdoc who is now a principal member of the technical staff at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory.
Evolution of technology
Until the late 1970s, the standard treatment for patients with blocked arteries near the heart was bypass surgery. Doctors then turned to the much less invasive process of reopening arteries with angioplasty balloons. Angioplasty quickly became the standard treatment for narrowed arteries, but it is not always a long-term solution because the arteries can eventually collapse again.
To prevent that, scientists developed stents — metal, cage-like structures that can hold an artery open indefinitely. However, these stents have problems of their own: When implanted, they provoke an immune response that can cause cells to accumulate near the stent and clog the artery again.
In 2003, the FDA approved the first drug-eluting stent for use in the United States, which releases drugs that prevent cells from clumping in the arteries. Drug-eluting stents are now the primary choice for treating blocked arteries, but they also have side effects: The drugs can cause blood to clot over time, which has led to death in some patients. Patients who receive these stents now need to take other medications, such as aspirin and Plavix, to counteract blood clotting.
Edelman’s lab is investigating a possible alternative to the current treatments: drug-coated balloons. “We’re trying to understand how and when this therapy could work and identify the conditions in which it may not,” Kolachalama says. “It has its merits; it has some disadvantages.”
Modeling drug release
The drug-coated balloons are delivered by a catheter and inflated at the narrowed artery for about 30 seconds, sometimes longer. During that time, the balloon coating, containing a drug such as Zotarolimus, is released from the balloon. The properties of the coating allow the drug to be absorbed in the body’s tissues. Once the drug is released, the balloon is removed.
In their new study, Kolachalama, Edelman and colleagues set out to rigorously characterize the properties of the drug-coated balloons. After performing experiments in tissue grown in the lab and in pigs, they developed a computer model that explains the dynamics of drug release and distribution. They found that factors such as the size of the balloon, the duration of delivery time, and the composition of the drug coating all influence how long the drug stays at the injury site and how effectively it clears the arteries.
One significant finding is that when the drug is released, some of it sticks to the lining of the blood vessels. Over time, that drug is slowly released back into the tissue, which explains why the drug’s effects last much longer than the initial 30-second release period.
“This is the first time we can explain the reasons why drug-coated balloons can work,” Kolachalama says. “The study also offers areas where people can consider thinking about optimizing drug transfer and delivery.”
In future studies, Edelman, Kolachalama and colleagues plan to further examine how blood flow affects drug delivery. They also plan to study a variety of different drugs and drug coating compositions, as well as how the balloons behave in different types of arteries.
The National Institutes of Health and Abbott Vascular funded the research.

By Nicole Lee posted May 21st, 2013 at 7:49 PM 0
There are plenty of kits out there designed to help kids learn the ins and outs of electronics, but LightUp hopes to stand out from the crowd with not just easy-to-use building blocks but an accompanying augmented reality app as well. From resistors and LED modules to light sensors, each block represents a real component that can be attached to each other via magnetic connectors, hopefully creating a circuit in the process. LightUp even offers an Arduino-compatible microcontroller block to help kids start coding -- clip the programming wand to the block, hook it up to your computer, and away you go.
What really sets LightUp apart is the aforementioned AR app. Simply snap a picture of your circuit, and the software will let you know what's wrong with it if there's a mistake. If everything's working, it'll display an electrical flow animation atop the picture, showing kids the magic of electricity. We had a go at creating a circuit ourselves, and were delighted at how easy it was. The connectors fit in either direction, and can be attached and reattached with ease. We also saw a brief demo of the prototype application, and sure enough, it showed us when an LED block was placed backwards with an error message -- you can see it in action in the video below.

If you're keen on getting a kit of your own, LightUp recently launched their Kickstarter campaign to help make that happen. Kits range from a $49 mini set that holds just a few basic blocks to the deluxe $199 box that carries every single component the company offers. The team also hopes to have a production app ready to go in both Google Play and iTunes once the finished product ships.

Tuesday, May 21, 2013
Nutritional supplement delays advancement of Parkinson's and Familial Dysautonomia, TAU researchers discover
Widely available in pharmacies and health stores, phosphatidylserine is a natural food supplement produced from beef, oysters, and soy. Proven to improve cognition and slow memory loss, it's a popular treatment for older people experiencing memory impairment. Now a team headed by Prof. Gil Ast and Dr. Ron Bochner of Tel Aviv University's Department of Human Molecular Genetics has discovered that the same supplement improves the functioning of genes involved in degenerative brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Familial Dysautonomia (FD).
In FD, a rare genetic disorder that impacts the nervous system and appears almost exclusively in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, a genetic mutation prevents the brain from manufacturing healthy IKAP proteins — which likely have a hand in cell migration and aiding connections between nerves — leading to the early degeneration of neurons. When the supplement was applied to cells taken from FD patients, the gene function improved and an elevation in the level of IKAP protein was observed, reports Prof. Ast. These results were replicated in a second experiment which involved administering the supplement orally to mouse populations with FD.
The findings, which have been published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics, are very encouraging, says Prof. Ast. "That we see such an effect on the brain — the most important organ in relation to this disease — shows that the supplement can pass through the blood-brain barrier even when administered orally, and accumulate in sufficient amounts in the brain."
Slowing the death of nerve cells
Already approved for use as a supplement by the FDA, phosphatidylserine contains a molecule essential for transmitting signals between nerve cells in the brain. Prof. Ast and his fellow researchers decided to test whether the same chemical, which is naturally synthesized in the body and known to boost memory capability, could impact the genetic mutation which leads to FD.
Researchers applied a supplement derived from oysters, provided by the Israeli company Enzymotec, to cells collected from FD patients. Noticing a robust effect on the gene, including a jump in the production of healthy IKAP proteins, they then tested the same supplement on mouse models of FD, engineered with the same genetic mutation that causes the disease in humans.
The mice received the supplement orally, every two days for a period of three months. Researchers then conducted extensive genetic testing to assess the results of the treatment. "We found a significant increase of the protein in all the tissues of the body," reports Prof. Ast, including an eight-fold increase in the liver and 1.5-fold increase in the brain. "While the food supplement does not manufacture new nerve cells, it probably delays the death of existing ones," he adds.
Therapeutic potential for Parkinson's
That the supplement is able to improve conditions in the brain, even when given orally, is a significant finding, notes Prof. Ast. Most medications enter the body through the blood stream, but are incapable of breaking through the barrier between the blood and the brain.
In addition, the researchers say the supplement's positive effects extend beyond the production of IKAP. Not only did phosphatidylserine impact the gene associated with FD, but it also altered the level of a total of 2400 other genes — hundreds of which have been connected to Parkinson's disease in previous studies.
The researchers believe that the supplement may have a beneficial impact on a number of degenerative diseases of the brain, concludes Prof. Ast, including a major potential for the development of new medications which would help tens of millions of people worldwide suffering from these devastating diseases.

UofL scientists uncover how grapefruits provide a secret weapon in medical drug delivery
University of Louisville researchers have uncovered how to create nanoparticles using natural lipids derived from grapefruit, and have discovered how to use them as drug delivery vehicles. UofL scientists Huang-Ge Zhang, D.V.M., Ph.D., Qilong Wang, Ph.D., and their team today (May 21, 2013), published their findings in Nature Communications.
Lipids (right panel first three tubes) derived from grapefruit. GNVs can efficiently deliver a variety of therapeutic agents, including DNA, RNA (DIR-GNVs), proteins and anti-cancer drugs (GNVs-Drugs) as demonstrated in this study.
Grapefruits have long been known for their health benefits, and the subtropical fruit may revolutionize how medical therapies like anti-cancer drugs are delivered to specific tumor cells.
University of Louisville researchers have uncovered how to create nanoparticles using natural lipids derived from grapefruit, and have discovered how to use them as drug delivery vehicles. UofL scientists Huang-Ge Zhang, D.V.M., Ph.D., Qilong Wang, Ph.D., and their team today (May 21, 2013), published their findings in Nature Communications .
“These nanoparticles, which we’ve named grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNVs), are derived from an edible plant, and we believe they are less toxic for patients, result in less biohazardous waste for the environment, and are much cheaper to produce at large scale than nanoparticles made from synthetic materials,” Zhang said.
The researchers demonstrated that GNVs can transport various therapeutic agents, including anti-cancer drugs, DNA/RNA and proteins such as antibodies. Treatment of animals with GNVs seemed to cause less adverse effects than treatment with drugs encapsulated in synthetic lipids.
“Our GNVs can be modified to target specific cells – we can use them like missiles to carry a variety of therapeutic agents for the purpose of destroying diseased cells,” he said. “Furthermore, we can do this at an affordable price.”
The therapeutic potential of grapefruit derived nanoparticles was further validated through a Phase 1 clinical trial for treatment of colon cancer patients. So far, researchers have observed no toxicity in the patients who orally took the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin encapsulated in grapefruit nanoparticles.
The UofL scientists also plan to test whether this technology can be applied in the treatment of inflammation related autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
A Common Sense Approach
Zhang said he began this research by considering how our ancestors selected food to eat.
“The fruits and vegetables we buy from the grocery today were passed down from generation to generation as favorable and nutritious for the human body. On the flip side, outcomes were not favorable for our ancestors who ate poisonous mushrooms, for example,” he said. “It made sense for us to consider eatable plants as a mechanism to create medical nanoparticles as a potential non-toxic therapeutic delivery vehicle.”
In addition to grapefruit, Zhang and his team analyzed the nanoparticles from tomatoes and grapes. Grapefruits were chosen for further exploration because a larger quantity of lipids can be derived from this fruit.

A 3D food printer could feed astronauts during long-distance space travel, Systems & Materials Research Corporation, just got a six month, $125,000 grant from NASA to create a pizza-printing prototype.
Anjan Contractor , who founded the company, developed a food printer would use cartridges of powders and oils -- shelf-stable for up to 30 years -- to create customized, nutritionally-appropriate meals from sugars, complex carbohydrates, protein and other basic building blocks.
Quartz reports that Contractor will begin building his pizza printer within two weeks. It works by first printing a layer of dough, which is baked by a heated plate at the bottom of the printer. Then it prints a tomato layer made from a powder base mixed with water and oil, followed by a final protein layer.
Contractor's printer is based on the open-source RepRap 3D printer, and he plans to keep his software open source as well. He envisions a future where every kitchen has a 3D food printer, and people create and share "recipes" as they might create and share apps.
The sources of the organic base powders used for printing could come from anywhere, including insects, algae and grass.
The prototype for Contractor's pizza printer was a simpler chocolate printer, which was not the first of its kind, but this trial video was enough to win the grant through NASA's Small Business Innovation Research Program.

Scientists studied radiation data gathered by Planck telescope
Claim anomalies show gravitational pull from other universes
Could be the first real evidence to support controversial theory
Share
The first 'hard evidence' that other universes exist has been found by scientists.
Cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the Planck spacecraft have concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes.
The map shows radiation from the Big Bang 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation.
Scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed, but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a 'cold spot' that cannot be explained by current understanding of physics.
Laura Mersini-Houghton, theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Richard Holman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, predicted that anomalies in radiation existed and were caused by the pull from other universes in 2005.

Now that she has studied the Planck data, Dr Mersini-Houghton believes her hypothesis has been proven.
Her findings imply there could be an infinite number of universes outside of our own.
She said: 'These anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the Big Bang.
'They are the first hard evidence for the existence of other universes that we have seen.'
Detailed: Planck data has been used to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old
Better quality: Previous maps of radiation (left) were not as detailed as the recent Planck map (right)
Although some scientists remain  sceptical about the theory of other universes, these findings may be a  step towards changing views on physics.
The European Space Agency, which runs the �515million Planck telescope, said: 'Because precision of Planck’s map is so  high, it made it possible to reveal some peculiar unexplained  features that may well require new physics to be understood.'
Cambridge professor of theoretical physics Malcolm Perry told the Sunday Times that the findings could be real evidence of the existence of other universes.
While George Efstathiou, professor of astrophysics at the university, told the newspaper: 'Such ideas may sound wacky now, just like the Big Bang theory did three generations ago. But then we got evidence and now it has changed the whole way we think about the universe.'

http://phys.org/news/2013-05-gold-nanoparticles-ovarian-cancer.html|How gold nanoparticles can help fight ovarian cancer
May 21, Nanotechnology/Bio & Medicine
Positively charged gold nanoparticles are usually toxic to cells, but cancer cells somehow manage to avoid nanoparticle toxicity. Mayo Clinic researchers found out why, and determined how to make the nanoparticles effective against ovarian cancer cells. The discovery is detailed in the current online issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry.
"This study identifies a novel mechanism that protects ovarian cancer cells by preventing the cell death or apoptosis which should occur when they encounter positively charged nanoparticles," say the senior authors of this study, Priyabrata Mukherjee, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic molecular biologist, and Y.S. Prakash, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic anesthesiologist and physiologist.
Why Cancer Cells Survived
Gold nanoparticles can have many medical uses, from imaging and aiding diagnoses to delivering therapies. In this case, using a special preparation to put positive ionic charges on the surface, the nanoparticle is intended to act as a targeted destructor of tumor cells while leaving healthy cells alone. The nanoparticles are supposed to kill cells by causing cellular calcium ion levels to increase. But researchers discovered that a regulatory protein in the mitochondria essentially buffers the rising calcium by transporting it into the mitochondria, thus subverting cell death. Cancer cells have an abundance of this transporter and may thus be protected from nanoparticle toxicity.
The research team discovered that if they inhibit calcium uptake into the mitochondria, sufficient cellular stress builds up, making the gold nanoparticles more effective in destroying cancer cells.
The researchers say that understanding how mitochondrial transport mechanisms work will help in the design of targeted therapies against cancer. They called for nanoparticle developers to integrate this new mechanistic knowledge into their processes for designing nanoparticle properties to be used in therapy.

Predicted SIDS Infant death rates for normal women*
Table 4 shows that for room sharing breast-fed babies placed supine, and whose parents do not smoke and have no other risk factors,                                     the SIDS rate is predicted to be 0.08 (0.05 to 0.14)/1000 live-births. This rate is predicted to increase by 2.7 times (1.4                                     to 5.3) to 0.23 (0.11 to 0.49)/1000 when bed sharing. For all combinations of risk factors, the predicted increases in risk                                     associated with bed sharing are statistically significant. These rates may be scaled up or down depending on the population                                     SIDS rate, and other factors present; see online supplementary appendix for details. For example, from tables 1 ⇑ ⇑ and 4 , we find that a 2.25 kg bottle-fed baby bed sharing with an 18-year-old mother, who smokes and regularly takes 2+ units of                                     alcohol and whose partner also smokes, has a predicted SIDS rate of 125/1000, that is, 12.5% (see online supplementary table                                     b) in online supplementary appendix.

Mitchell 21 recently reviewed the risks and benefits of bed sharing; he concluded that the postulated benefits and guidelines for bed                                  sharing safely are not evidence based. He also found that there is only one small group with no increased risk of SIDS when bed sharing, namely breast-fed infants over 3 months whose parents do not smoke, and whose mother                                  does not take 2 or more units of alcohol or drugs and does not cosleep on a sofa. Mitchell urged that parents had a right                                  to know the risks they are exposing their infants to when bed sharing, but was unable to quantify these risks.
This study combines five major SIDS case–control studies. It includes 1472 cases and 4679 controls, making it the largest                                  study of SIDS risk factors with individual level data. By combining individual data, this design allows the interaction of                                  risk factors such as breastfeeding, infant age and smoking to be examined in relation to bed sharing and SIDS. Accordingly,                                  it is able to examine the interplay of the risk factors related to bed sharing in depth as never before. Our findings confirm                                  Mitchell's conclusions and quantify the relative risks and predicted SIDS rates associated with bed sharing in a variety of circumstances.
It has been suggested that we should have taken into account the partner's alcohol consumption in the last 24 h and his drug                                  use. We did not include the former factor because, in the analysis of the ECAS study, it was found that the partner's consumption                                  of alcohol was correlated with that of the mother and did not add further to the risk of SIDS. 7 To check on this possibility, we have gone back to the original records for the key subgroup, namely babies <3 months who                                  were breastfed and whose parents did not smoke and whose mother took less than 2 units of alcohol in the last 24 h and did                                  not use drugs, who either bed shared or room shared. We find that in both the bed sharing and room sharing groups, the control                                  partners had taken slightly more alcohol in the last 24 h than the partners of cases. Consequently, if we adjusted for this factor, it would increase the                                  OR for bed sharing. We also note that the subgroup OR based on the complete data is 5.6 (1.6 to 20.3), which is almost identical                                  to the adjusted AOR for this group 5.1 (2.3 to 11.4: table 3 ).
To respond to the criticism that the missing data in relation to alcohol and drug use in three of the five datasets make any                                  attempt to exclude the contribution of these factors to the risks associated with bed sharing completely unreliable, we have                                  gone back to the original records for bed sharing cases in the key subgroup. Most of these records include pertinent questions                                  on alcohol use, but not maternal use, in the last 24 h. This enabled us to establish that neither alcohol nor drug use contributed                                  in any way to any of these deaths.
Also, as discussed in more detail in the online supplementary appendix, because missing data are primarily determined by the                                  study; by including a ‘study’ when modelling the subset of complete data and modelling the imputed data, the results of both                                  will be essentially unbiased. In this setting, multiple imputations are expected primarily to recover information by including                                  the partially observed records in the analysis, which is what we found. Consequently, we can be confident of our estimate                                  of the adjusted effect of bed sharing from the imputed data.
Importantly, the combined data have enabled the demonstration of increased relative risk associated with bed sharing when                                  the baby is breastfed and neither parent smokes and no other risk factors are present (see figure 2 and table 2 ). The average risk is in the first 3 months and is 5.1 (2.3 to 11.4) times greater than if the baby is put to sleep supine                                  on a cot in the parents’ room ( table 3 ). This increased risk is unlikely to be due to chance (p=0.000059). Bias could occur because these estimates are based on models fitted to all the data or to all the data relating to infants under 3 months of age. Moreover, checks show that the models accurately describe the data, especially those relating to cases whose                                  only risk factor is bed sharing; see online supplementary appendix. Bias is also possible due to the selection of the studies.                                  However, the present study incorporates far more data than were included in Vennemann et al's 26 recent meta-analysis of the ORs for bed sharing in infants of non-smoking mothers. The meta-analysis produced summary ORs                                  that were very similar to those reported in this study. Furthermore, our findings are very unlikely to be due to confounding since the AORs are adjusted for all the major SIDS risk factors. Although the partner's consumption of alcohol is not included                                  in the dataset, it was found in the ECAS study that this factor was correlated with mother's alcohol consumption (r=0.52)                                  and, after taking account of the mother's alcohol consumption, it did not add further to the prediction of risk. 7
Mitchell's 21 review of the mechanisms by which bed sharing might cause SIDS shows that a causal pathway is not unreasonable. Box 1 reviews the evidence that the association of bed sharing, when mothers do not smoke, have not taken alcohol or use drugs,                                  with SIDS is causal by Bradford Hill's criteria. 31 Clearly, bed sharing in the white European context can be a causal factor for SIDS, especially in the first 3 months in the                                  absence of other factors. It has been argued that because the risk of bed sharing is greatly increased by parental smoking,                                  alcohol and/or drugs, it is the way we bed share rather than bed sharing itself that is important. Parental smoking greatly                                  enhances the risk of SIDS associated with bed sharing, but in what way their pattern of bed sharing differs from that of non-smokers                                  is not obvious. Although breastfeeding is lower among smokers than non-smokers, 46% of cases of bed sharing smokers were breastfeeding                                  and 61% of controls. These figures are lower than for non-smokers, 62% and 73%, respectively, but these differences do not                                  demonstrate that parental smoking results in a different way of bed sharing. For non-smokers and smokers alike, sleeping in                                  a ‘western style’ bed with a baby carries a risk of SIDS. Why the risk is so greatly enhanced by parental smoking is not known.
Box 1
Assessment of bed sharing, in the absence of parental smoking alcohol and maternal drug use, as a causal risk for SIDS by                                        Bradford Hill's criteria 31
Strength of association
Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) for bed sharing=2.7 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.3), p=0.0027, for breastfed infants with no other risk factors.                                              AOR for the first 3 months of life=5.1 (2.3 to 11.4), p=0.00006. These AORs are moderately strong.
Consistent
Of more than 12 published studies, all but two small ones show, after multivariate adjustment, increased risk of SIDS associated                                              with bed sharing, some combined with sofa sharing. 26
SPECIFIC × (not an essential criterion)
Smoking, alcohol and drug use all have greatly increased risk when bed sharing
Bed sharing is associated with other causes of death, eg, Suffocation.
SIDS can occur in the absence of bed sharing.
Temporally correct
Bed sharing always precedes SIDS.
Dose response
New Zealand study showed risk increased with duration of bed sharing. 32 Not otherwise investigated.
Biologically plausible
Bed sharing risk is greatest to youngest infants who are most vulnerable.
Coherence
The proposition that bed sharing is causally related to SIDS is coherent with theories that respiratory obstruction, re-breathing                                              expired gases, and thermal stress (or overheating), which may also give rise to the release of lethal toxins, 33 are all mechanisms leading to SIDS, in the absence of smoking, alcohol or drugs. Infants placed prone are exposed to similar                                              hazards.

Analogy
Overlying is a serious cause of mortality in piglets. Sows are normally separated by a bar from piglets to prevent them being                                              crushed when she turns over, but allowing her piglets to feed.
Recently, there has been a tendency to record unexplained bed sharing infant deaths as due to ‘suffocation-bed’ (ICD code                                  E913/W75) 34 , 35 or ‘undetermined’, rather than SIDS when the baby was bed sharing and may have suffocated. 36 However, an investigation into deaths certified as SIDS and unascertained by the UK Office of National Statistics found that                                  many of their characteristics were very similar, 37 and now ONS reports these deaths together as unexplained deaths in infancy. 38 In 2004, Limerick and Bacon, 39 in a study of terminology used by pathologists in reporting SIDS, found that when giving the cause of death of an infant                                  found unexpectedly dead while bed sharing, only 1 in 70 said asphyxia. The selection of cases in our studies includes all                                  such deaths. Certifying such deaths under headings other than SIDS does nothing to minimise the tragedy.
Other new findings
The risk of SIDS for an average family with no known modifiable risk factors— table 4 baseline (breast-fed, non-smoking, non-drinking parents who are room sharing and not bed sharing)–was 0.08/1000 live-births.                                     This is the level of SIDS that might be achieved if all known modifiable risk factors were removed. Such a SIDS level may                                     be deemed intrinsic (possibly genetic) and not directly amenable to behaviour modification. This rate is consistent with countries                                     reporting low SIDS rates. National surveys in the Netherlands show that, following an active campaign to discourage bed sharing, 4 bed sharing rates have fallen from 13% in 1999, to 10% in 2005, to 1.5% always bed sharing and 3.1% sometimes bed sharing                                     in 2011 (M L'Hoir, Personal communication Apr, 2012). During the same period, as part of a general downward trend in SIDS mortality, 40 SIDS rates have fallen by 25% from 0.12 in 2000 to 0.09/1000 in 2010. 41 , 42 At the same time, the percentage of infants being breastfed at 3 months of age has risen from 45% to 52%, and at 6 months                                     from 24% to 32%, 43 confirming that promotion of bed sharing is not necessary to achieve high rates of prolonged breastfeeding.
A recent study commissioned by UNICEF 44 suggests that the promotion of breastfeeding and support of breastfeeding mothers in the UK would reduce the burden of disease                                     on the National Health Service and could thereby be cost-effective. However, if bed sharing is promoted as a means of encouraging                                     breastfeeding, it is likely to increase the number of SIDS because AOR for bed sharing, 2.7, is nearly double that for bottle                                     feeding, 1.5. Consequently, such an approach would be likely to increase the number of SIDS cases. If SIDS deaths are costed at more than £1.5 million each, as in the UNICEF report, the costs resulting                                     from any increase in bed sharing would far outweigh any benefits from the increased breastfeeding rates, quite apart from                                     the disastrous consequences for families associated with the loss of a child. To reap the benefit of increasing the breastfeeding                                     duration and rates, the Dutch recommendations should be followed, namely: ‘To achieve maximal security for the baby and optimal                                     availability of breastfeeding, mothers are advised to take the baby of less than 4 months of age into their bed for feeding                                     during the night, but afterwards to place the baby on its back into his own crib, placed adjacent to the parents’ bed in the                                     parents’ bedroom’. 5
Thus, we do not suggest that babies should not be brought into the parent's bed for comfort and feeding. This has been investigated                                     in previous studies and has not been found to be a risk factor, provided the infant is returned to his or her own cot. 45 , 46 This study is concerned with the risks associated with sleeping with a baby in bed. Tables 3 and 4 of this report are designed to enable an informed choice to be made by parents as to whether the risks associated with bed                                     sharing outweigh the postulated benefits. However, our models predict that 88% of the deaths that occurred while bed sharing                                     would probably not have occurred had the baby been placed on its back in a cot by the parents’ bed. Even for the very low-risk                                     breast-fed babies under 3 months of age, with no risk factors other than that they slept in their parents’ bed, the model                                     predicts that 81% (78.9% to 82%) of the deaths could have been readily prevented in this way. One has to ask whether it is                                     worth taking the risk, however small, of losing a baby, when it can be so easily avoided.
Previous epidemiological studies have shown that being placed on the front, prone, for sleep was a risk factor for SIDS and                                     fulfilled similar criteria as a causal risk for SIDS; in the 1970s, OR was 2.9 (1.2 to 7.5) and in 1986 from five pooled case–control                                     studies, OR was 3.0 (1.7 to 5.3). 2 A campaign to reduce prone sleeping effectively halved the number of SIDS cases worldwide between 1990 and 2000, saving thousands                                     of babies in the developed world. Delay in implementing an effective ‘back to sleep’ campaign is estimated to have resulted                                     in the deaths of 10 000 infants in the UK alone. 2
Recent case studies indicate that now 50% or more of SIDS cases 18 , 47 occur while bed sharing in contrast to 22% in this study, table 1 . In the UK, possibly due to the pro bed sharing lobby 14 in the 10 years between the two studies by Blair and colleagues, 46 , 18 the percentage of cases bed sharing (excluding sofa sharing) doubled and the percentage of controls bed sharing increased                                     by 50% from 14.5% to 21.8%. Meanwhile, the crude unadjusted OR for bed sharing only changed from 2.0 to 2.2. (An adjusted                                     OR for bed sharing is not reported for the latter study.) Our analysis estimates that 88% of bed sharing deaths are attributable                                     to bed sharing, that is, would not have occurred had the baby not been bed sharing. The stability of the crude OR for bed                                     sharing despite the increase in the prevalence of bed sharing suggests that our estimate of attributable risk may reasonably                                     be applied currently. Consequently, our analysis suggests that about 90% of bed sharing SIDS deaths would not occur in the                                     absence of bed sharing.
The current messages saying that bed sharing is dangerous only if you or your partner are smokers, have been drinking alcohol                                     or taking drugs that make you drowsy, are very tired or the baby is premature or of low-birth weight, are not effective because                                     many of the bed sharing deaths involve these factors. Our findings suggest that professionals and the literature should take                                     a more definite stand against bed sharing, especially for babies under 3 months. If parents were made aware of the risks of                                     sleeping with their baby, and room sharing were promoted, as ‘Back to Sleep’ was promoted 20 years ago, a substantial further                                     reduction in SIDS rates could be achieved.

Many different views have developed about possible links between climate change and the appearance or disappearance of MSA industries such as the SB and HP in southern Africa. Early work speculated that the HP was the result of changes in the adaptation of an indigenous population in response to environmental change 50 . At the time, age control of the archaeological record, as well as the palaeenvironmental records, was not sufficient to test this hypothesis. It was later also argued that changes in the Earth’s orbital configuration led to the development of relatively cool and wet conditions in southern Africa during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4 (ref. 51 ), while speleothem deposits recovered at Pinnacle Point Cave on the southern coast suggest variable conditions prevailed at this time 14 , broadly coeval with the SB and HP industries. It has also been argued that rather than catastrophic events, variability associated with spatially and temporally complex climate conditions is a significant factor in itself 52 . Recently, McCall and Thomas 53 have taken this view further by proposing that the mobility patterns and organizational characteristics of the SB may have been part of a strategy for dealing with environmental unpredictability and short-term climate fluctuations that occurred during this interval. They argued that human populations were relatively large following expansion during the benign conditions of MIS 5, but the SB and HP industries followed as a stress response to the colder and more variable conditions of MIS 4. There have also been arguments for the origins of the SB and HP industries in demographic terms as bursts of population increase and consequent higher archaeological visibility 54 .
We find a striking correspondence between the archaeological record of South Africa and the timing of abrupt climate change as inferred from our CD154-17-17 marine palaeo-record on the chronology of the absolutely dated speleothem record ( Fig. 4 ). Major events of occupation in archaeological sites coincide consistently with North Atlantic cold events, weakened Asian summer monsoon periods and inferred increased river discharge and humid conditions in the Eastern Cape. The age of the SB industry (71.9–71.0 ka (ref. 7 )) coincides within the error margins with one of the most extreme cold events in the Northern Hemisphere (cold Greenland stadial 19), a period of a particularly weak Asian Monsoon lasting from ~72.8 to 71.5 ka. An earlier settlement (early SB) with plant bedding construction at Sibudu Cave (~77 ka) (ref. 12 ) can be also linked to one of the first abrupt North Atlantic cold events (cold Greenland stadial 20) at the MIS 5/4 transition (77.1–76.4 ka). Similarly, the duration of the HP industry (64.8–59.5 ka (ref. 7 )) coincides with cold conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean and a dry phase in Asia. Our record from core CD154-17-17K suggests particularly wet (humid) conditions in the Eastern Cape during each of these intervals. The abrupt ending of the HP industry at ~59.5 ka coincides with a rapid transition to drier conditions. During this transition, the Northern Hemisphere warmed abruptly (into MIS 3) and summer monsoon strength in West Africa and Asia increased. MSA events and occupation of the major sites during MIS 3 are rare. This may be explained by generally drier conditions in South Africa, whereas improved conditions in East Africa may have shifted the main focus of demographic expansion and innovation to that region. However, three well-dated occupational pulses at Sibudu Cave, which have been named as post-HP (58.5+/−1.4 ka), late MSA (47.7+/−1.4 ka) and final MSA (38.6+/−1.9 ka (ref. 8 )) again correlate well with abrupt Northern Hemisphere cold events (Heinrich events). Our marine sediment core again indicates again short pulses of wetter conditions in the Eastern Cape. Our findings are supported by evidence from Sibudu Cave, where sediments that have built up during occupational periods indicate relatively moist conditions 55 .

Credit: Marco Thines/Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung
More than 1 million people died of starvation and disease during the Irish Potato Famine (also known as the Great Famine), between 1845 and 1852—a     watershed event for the Irish that caused 1 million people to emigrate and fueled tension between Irish Catholics and Protestants in England who offered     little aid. All the suffering was triggered by the blight that wiped out a single species of potato—the so-called Irish "lumper"—that the Irish     depended on as a staple crop to feed their growing population.
Now, using DNA from dried lumper potato leaves in herbariums, an international team has sequenced the genome of the organism that ravaged the Irish potato crop and     found it was a single strain of the funguslike pathogen Phytophthora infestans -- not the common strain of blight that had long been the prime     suspect. It is the first time that scientists have decoded the genome of an ancient plant pathogen and its plant host from dried leaves—and the team     found it was a strain that has vanished. "An extinct strain caused the pandemic in Ireland and Europe," says Johannes Krause, a paleogeneticist at the     University of Tübingen in Germany who is co-author of the paper published today in the open-access journal eLife. "We found it in all these leaves     from Ireland, from England, from France, from Germany. One strain. Then, it just disappeared."
The international team of molecular biologists traced the historical spread of the P. infestans, a funguslike oomycete, which arose in the     Americas. The potato was first domesticated in modern-day Peru between 7000 and 10,000 years ago. The crop was introduced to Europe by Spanish explorers in     the 16th century, shortly after their conquest of the Inca Empire. It soon became an important food staple that played a major role in the 19th century     population boom in Europe. However, Europeans propagated the potato by planting a piece of potato—essentially growing clones of only a few varieties. As     a result, when the blight reached Ireland on ships traveling between America and Britain, P. infestans rapidly spread through Ireland, resulting     in the devastating famine. Even today, the Irish population of 4.5 million is less than three-quarters of what it was at the start of the famine.
With such potential to wreak havoc, the specific strain of P. infestans that caused the blight has been of great interest. Until now, researchers     thought the deadly culprit was a strain—called US-1—that was most common around the world except in South America and Mexico before the 1970s. To     test that idea, the molecular biologists traced the evolution of 11 ancient strains of the P. infestans from dried leaves of potatoes and tomatoes     collected from Europe, Great Britain, Ireland, and North American between 1845 and 1896 and stored at the herbaria of the Botanical State Collection Munich     and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The researchers extracted fragments of ancient DNA from the leaves and were surprised to find that the pathogen was so     well preserved that they could sequence the ancient DNA directly and reconstruct its genome. Then, they compared the ancient DNA of P. infestans with that of 15 modern strains of the pathogen.
They found that the strain that caused the famine, which they named HERB-1, emerged in the early 19th century, probably in the United States or Mexico. It     spread around the globe for another 50 years after the famine began but disappeared by the early 20th century, probably because farmers stopped planting     lumpers and began to breed resistant genes into potatoes. The US-1 strain, which has been blamed for the fatal blight, is closely related to HERB-1 and     arose from the same population. But it diverged in the Americas before the first major outbreak in Europe, says Hernan Burbano of the Max Planck Institute     for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, co-leader of the study.
Not only have the researchers solved the mystery of the strain that caused the famine, but they have also shown that dried leaves are an excellent source     of DNA from ancient pathogens—and opened a new area of research to understand how pathogens evolve and how humans influence the spread of plant disease.     "It's amazing that you can take dried leaves stored for years between two pieces of paper, extract the DNA, put it in a sequencing machine, and get its     genome," Krause says.
Other researchers agree. "It's a great sign that herbaria material should really be given a lot of consideration for future work," says evolutionary     geneticist Thomas Gilbert of the University of Copenhagen. He is the co-leader of a competing team, which has a paper in review at another journal. In that study, Gilbert and colleagues sequenced the DNA from potato leaves and focused on genes that differ between the ancient famine strain and modern strains of P. infestans. He thinks that further work should be done to test whether there was so little variation in the strains that caused the blight in     Ireland and Europe. Nonetheless, he adds, "I think it's a very nice paper. Obviously, I think it's a great idea."

Abstract: We analyze international co-authorship relations in the Social Science Citation Index 2011 using all citable items in the DVD-version of this index. Network statistics indicate four groups of nations: (i) an Asian-Pacific one to which all Anglo-Saxon nations (including the UK and Ireland) are attributed; (ii) a continental European one including also the Latin-American countries; (iii) the Scandinavian nations; and (iv) a community of African nations. Within the EU-28 (including Croatia), eleven of the EU-15 states have dominant positions. Collapsing the EU-28 into a single node leads to a bi-polar structure between the US and EU-28; China is part of the US-pole. We develop an information-theoretical test to distinguish whether international collaborations or domestic collaborations prevail; the results are mixed, but the international dimension is more important than the national one in the aggregated sets (this was found in both SSCI and SCI). In France, however, the national distribution is more important than the international one, while the reverse is true for most European nations in the core group (UK, Germany, the Netherlands, etc.). Decomposition of the USA in terms of states shows a similarly mixed result; more US states are domestically oriented in SSCI, whereas more internationally in SCI. The international networks have grown during the last decades in addition to the national ones, but not by replacing them.

By Victoria Gill Science reporter, BBC News
Prof Dan Goldman explains how fire ants manage to tunnel quickly through fine, loose sand
Ants turned into 'supersoldiers'
A study showing how ants tunnel their way through confined spaces could aid the design of search-and-rescue robots, according to US scientists.
A team from the Georgia Institute of Technology found fire ants can use their antennae as "extra limbs" to catch themselves when they fall, and can build stable tunnels in loose sand.
Researchers used high speed cameras to record in detail this behaviour.
The findings are published in the journal PNAS .

We could watch these glass tunnels and really see what all the body parts were doing when the ants were climbing and slipping and falling”
End Quote Nick Gravish Georgia Institute of Technology
Dr Nick Gravish, who led the research, designed "scientific grade ant farms" - allowing the ants to dig through sand trapped between two plates of glass, so every tunnel and every movement could be viewed and filmed.
"These ants would move at very high speeds," he explained, "and if you slowed down the motion, (you could see) it wasn't graceful movement - they have many slips and falls."
Crucially, the insects were able to gather themselves almost imperceptibly quickly after each fall.
To see how they managed this, the team set up a second experiment where, to move from their nest to their food source, the ants had to pass through a labyrinth of smooth glass tunnels.
"We could watch these glass tunnels and really see what all the body parts were doing when the ants were climbing and slipping and falling," said Dr Gravish.
Fire ants are able to tunnel through almost any type of soil, a key reason why they are such a successful invasive species
The researchers were surprised to see that the ants would not just use their legs to catch themselves, but also engaged their antennae, essentially using these sensory "sniffing" appendages as extra limbs to support their weight.
Tune the environment
Finally, the researchers wanted to look inside the hidden labyrinths that the ants constructed underground, so they put ants into containers full of sand or soil and allowed them to dig.
They then built a "homemade X-Ray CT scanner", just like a medical scanner, to take 3D snapshots of the tunnels that the ants dug in different types of soil.
"We found that ant groups all dug tunnels of the same diameter, [no matter what the] soil conditions were," said Dr Gravish.

Bed sharing may increase risk of SIDS by five times
istockphoto
Sharing a bed with an infant significantly increases their risk of dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), according to a new study published online on May 20 in BMJ Open .
Even if the parents are non-smokers and the mother did not abuse illegal drugs or drink alcohol before bedtime -- other risk factors for SIDS -- bed sharing still increased the risk of a child dying from SIDS more than five times.
"The current messages saying that bed sharing is dangerous only if you or your partner are smokers, have been drinking alcohol or taking drugs that make you drowsy, are very tired or the baby is premature or of low-birth weight, are not effective," the authors wrote in the study, adding that doctors need to "take a more definitive stance against bed sharing for babies under three months".
SIDS is when an infant unexpectedly dies when they are less than 1 years old with no obvious explanation for his or hear death. It is the leading cause of death among infants under 12 months and the third-leading cause of all infant deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The CDC estimates that there are 4,200 SIDS deaths annually.
Rates have declined more than 50 percent in the U.S. thanks to parents being advised to put sleeping infants in the supine position or on their backs, but rates are still disproportionately higher for non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native infants, the CDC stated.

Researchers looked at 1,472 SIDS cases and 4,679 infant controls from five published data sets from the U.K., Europe, Australia and Asia. They determined that 88 percent of SIDS deaths while bed sharing would not had happened if the parents didn't sleep in the same bed as the infant. Even for low-risk breast-fed babies who had no other risk factors that died from SIDS, 81 percent of the deaths of infants below three months of age could have been prevented if they were placed in their own bed.
In 22.2 percent of cases, one parent or both parents were sleeping in the same bed as the child at the time of death. Only 9.6 parents in the control group shared a bed with their infant at the time they were interviewed.
The risk of SIDS while bed sharing went down as the infant grew older, but other factors including if the parents were smokers or if the mother drank two or more units of alcohol within 24 hours or used illegal drugs, increased the risk.
"We do not suggest that babies should not be brought into the parent's bed for comfort and feeding. This has been investigated in previous studies and has not been found to be a risk factor, provided the infant is returned to his or her own cot for sleep," they wrote.
Dr. Rachel Moon, a pediatrician at Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics task force on SIDS, told LiveScience that this is an important study because it shows that sharing a bed is dangerous for a child.
"Even if you do everything right, bed sharing increases a baby's risk," Moon said.
Francine Bates, chief executive of the British baby charity, The Lullaby Trust, told WebMD Boots that the study shows that parents who choose to share a bed with their infants should be cautious.
"We recognize that some parents will choose to sleep with their babies as opposed to placing them in a cot or a Moses basket next to their bed," she said. "The Lullaby Trust supports parental choice but we would also urge every new mother and father to weigh up the known risks of sharing a bed with their baby and, in light of their own situation, take appropriate precautions. Our core message remains that the safest place for a baby to sleep for the first six months is in a crib or cot in the same room as a parent or carer."
The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) advises parents to place sleeping infants on their back, put them to sleep on a firm surface, and put the child to sleep in the same room but not in the same bed. The academy also suggests keeping soft objects, loose bedding and anything a child can get trapped in or strangled by out of the crib.

How tornado victims got 25 minutes of precious warning time

Moore Tornado Radar
Twenty-five minutes.
That might not seem very long -- about the time it takes to wade through  your favorite weekly sitcom if you fast forward past the commercials.  But compared to a few decades ago, 25 minutes of time might have saved  countless lives during the devastating tornado that struck Moore,  Oklahoma on Monday.
Years ago, the residents of Moore would have likely had no idea the  tornado was coming until the twister was sighted, giving people barely  a few minutes' notice. But thanks to advancements in technology,  tornadoes rarely sneak up on anyone anymore.
In fact, forecasters as early as Wednesday began sounding the alarm for a  potential severe weather breakout on Sunday and, on Friday, the  forecasts became more specific. On Sunday, a Tornado Watch, which indicates  conditions are right for tornadic development, was issued at 1:10 p.m. for much of Oklahoma , including the greater Oklahoma City area.
The first tornado warning went out at 2:40 p.m. for the massive tornado as it touched down in Newcastle, Oklahoma, but the National Weather Service was giving informal warnings even before that.
Here are a series of Tweets from @NWSNorman that were also posted simultaneously on their Facebook page:
2:08 p.m.: "Storms developing near Blanchard and Tuttle, moving NE at 30mph. Stay alert Norman, Moore, and S OKC. Not severe yet."
2:30 p.m.: "people in south OKC, Moore and north Norman need to pay VERY close attention to the storm near Newcastle"
2:34 p.m.: "One warning forecaster focusing on big supercell west of OKC"
2:39 p.m.: "storm west of Newcastle is intensifying and showing some rotation. Stay alert! No tornado warning yet"
2:40 p.m.: "TORNADO WARNING for OKC metro! Developing tornado new Newcastle moving E 20 mph. Take shelter!!"
Another tweet at 2:45 p.m. mentions Moore is in the path and is giving safety tips.
At 2:56 p.m the tornado is now on the ground in Newcastle -- 16 minutes after the warning was issued. It's heading for Moore.
At 3:01 p.m., the National Weather Service issued a "Tornado Emergency" for Moore and south Oklahoma City. A Tornado Emergency is a step above a "Tornado Warning" and is used when a massive and extremely large tornado is imminent, as was the case here.
3:02 p.m.: "LARGE VIOLENT TORNADO moving toward Moore and SW OKC. Take cover right NOW!! Do not wait!!"
3:03 p.m.: "This is as serious as it gets for SW OKC and Moore. Please seek shelter now!"
3:14 p.m.: "Large, deadly tornado moving into Moore near 134th and Western"
3:19 p.m.: "TORNADO Approaching area near Warren Theater in Moore! Please take shelter. This is as bad as it gets"
3:21 p.m.: "TORNADO EMERGENCY for the City of Moore. Get as far inside a sturdy building as you can. Cover up! Do not wait!"
Then, this daunting tweet:
3:22 p.m.: "The tornado is so large you may not realize it's a tornado. If you are in Moore, go to shelter NOW!"
The tornado would push through the city between 3:25 and 3:32 p.m. dissipating at 3:36 p.m. after creating a path of destruction 17 miles long and at least a 1.3 miles wide.
But residents of Moore had nearly half an hour under an official tornado emergency to seek shelter, and had been given initial warnings nearly an hour in advance.
Long range forecasting advancements
As forecasting models get better and better with new technology, it allows meteorologists to get an earlier heads up on the potential for severe weather development. NOAA's Storm Prediction Center issues a daily "Convective Outlook" that highlights potential threats across the nation out as much as 4-8 days in advance.  This map was for Tuesday, May 21:
As I mentioned earlier, forecasters started getting worried about Sunday's storms as early as last Wednesday and concern became heightened on Friday when it looked like a very volatile mix of severe weather ingredients were set to mix together in that area.
As the time approaches, higher-resolution forecast models that focus on the near term can get a much better grip on which areas will have strong potential for severe weather.  It's up to the Storm Prediction Center to issue Severe Thunderstorms or Tornado Watches across the U.S. It did so in Moore's case about 2 hours before the storms struck, but it is up to individual National Weather Service forecast offices to put out warnings, as the local office in Norman, Oklahoma did.
Hail to the Doppler Radar
But perhaps the single biggest weapon meteorologists have in forecasting tornadoes is our NEXRAD Doppler radar. These high-powered radars can see the storms in 3-D and can now pick up on rotation inside a thunderstorm and potential tornado development even before the funnel forms, allowing for even more warning time.
If you've been watching the live coverage of the storms from local meteorologists in Oklahoma, you might have seen a somewhat unfamiliar radar product that shows red and green blobs instead of the traditional green/yellow/orange/red/purple blobs of a rain-detecting radar.
This is what's called a "velocity scan" and what the radar is doing is what you would expect a "Doppler" radar would do best -- measuring the doppler shift of particles. This data is extremely useful in detecting rotation.
Here is one such picture of the radar as the tornado was in Moore:
The red lines indicate particles that are coming toward the radar beam while green indicates going away. The radar site is noted by the "TOKC" dot there.  This would generally just indicate a northeast wind across the area -- reds to the northeast show wind coming at the radar; green to the southwest shows wind going away. But note the "couplet" of red and green swirling around Moore-- that's the radar picking up the strong rotation -- the red area showing the wind blowing away, the green to the left blowing toward the radar.
This particular case it shows up quite obviously due to the size of the tornado but the radar can pick up much more subtle nuances of rotation when storms are in their infant stages.
The radars can also detect the debris being spun around in a tornado -- which can give further confirmation to a forecaster that a tornado is on the ground, even if it's hidden from sight by heavy rain or darkness.
The radars can now show storm details down to street level, and software can compute the storm's expected track to give towns an expected arrival time down to the minute.
Cell phones have become personal weather alert systems
It used to be that emergency managers relied heavily on NOAA Weather Radios, tornado sirens, and the Emergency Broadcast System to warn areas of impending tornadoes. They still do, and NOAA weather radios remain a must-have in severe weather country -- they are equipped to where they will sound an alarm if a tornado warning is issued, even if the radio is off.
But perhaps now the greatest advancement in warning the public is the cell phone. Do you remember back in December when we had a blizzard warning for the Cascades and everyone's cell phones chirped to life with the warning?
People told stories of being at the mall or in a public place and how eerie it was when everyone's cell phone started going off at the same time. It was a bit of a mistake here in that the warning was intended just for the mountains, but since many city areas share their county with the Cascades, the alert went out county wide and inadvertently covered some metro areas.
That same technology is used for tornado warnings and of course, is much more relevant in the Midwest. Now, when an urgent warning is issued by the National Weather Service, your phone acts just like those weather radios and can warn you of impending danger no matter where you are.
So with advancements in forecast technology and the much broader reach of ways to alert the public, we are much better off than we were just even 10-15 years ago. Sadly, due to the tornado's incredible strength, even with several minutes' warning time a lot of the shelters directly in the storm's path were no match for the sheer power of the winds, but there were still likely many lives saved by the timely warnings.

New Method for Producing Clean Hydrogen
Duke engineers devise new way to produce clean hydrogen
May 21, 2013 |
Article
Durham, NC - Duke University engineers have developed a novel method for producing clean hydrogen, which could prove essential to weaning society off of fossil fuels and their environmental implications.
While hydrogen is ubiquitous in the environment, producing and collecting molecular hydrogen for transportation and industrial uses is expensive and complicated. Just as importantly, a byproduct of most current methods of producing hydrogen is carbon monoxide, which is toxic to humans and animals.
The Duke engineers, using a new catalytic approach, have shown in the laboratory that they can reduce carbon monoxide levels to nearly zero in the presence of hydrogen and the harmless byproducts of carbon dioxide and water. They also demonstrated that they could produce hydrogen by reforming fuel at much lower temperatures than conventional methods, which makes it a more practical option.
Catalysts are agents added to promote chemical reactions. In this case, the catalysts were nanoparticle combinations of gold and iron oxide (rust), but not in the traditional sense. Current methods depend on gold nanoparticlesâ ability to drive the process as the sole catalyst, while the Duke researchers made both the iron oxide and the gold the focus of the catalytic process.
The study appears online in the May issue of the Journal of Catalysis, viewable at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951712004204 .
"Our ultimate goal is to be able to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells," said Titilayo "Titi" Shodiya, a graduate student working in the laboratory of senior researcher Nico Hotz, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering. "Everyone is interested in sustainable and non-polluting ways of producing useful energy without fossil fuels," said Shodiya, the paper's first author.
Fuel cells produce electricity through chemical reactions, most commonly involving hydrogen. Also, many industrial processes require hydrogen as a chemical reagent and vehicles are beginning to use hydrogen as a primary fuel source.
"We were able through our system to consistently produce hydrogen with less than 0.002 percent (20 parts per million) of carbon monoxide," Shodiya said.
The Duke researchers achieved these levels by switching the recipe for the nanoparticles used as catalysts for the reactions to oxidize carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich gases. Traditional methods of cleaning hydrogen, which are not nearly as efficient as this new approach, also involve gold-iron oxide nanoparticles as the catalyst, the researchers said.
"It had been assumed that the iron oxide nanoparticles were only 'scaffolds' holding the gold nanoparticles together, and that the gold was responsible for the chemical reactions," Sodiya said. "However, we found that increasing the surface area of the iron oxide dramatically increased the catalytic activity of the gold."
One of the newest approaches to producing renewable energy is the use of biomass-derived alcohol-based sources, such as methanol. When methanol is treated with steam, or reformed, it creates a hydrogen-rich mixture that can be used in fuel cells.
"The main problem with this approach is that it also produces carbon monoxide, which is not only toxic to life, but also quickly damages the catalyst on fuel cell membranes that are crucial to the functioning of a fuel cell," Hotz said. "It doesn't take much carbon monoxide to ruin these membranes."
The researchers ran the reaction for more than 200 hours and found no reduction in the ability of the catalyst to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide in the hydrogen gas.
"The mechanism for this is not exactly understood yet. However, while current thinking is that the size of the gold particles is key, we believe the emphasis of further research should focus on iron oxide's role in the process," Shodiya said.
The Duke team's research was supported by the California Energy Commission and the Oak Ridge Associated Universities. Duke postdoctoral associates Oliver Schmidt and Wen Peng were also part of the research team.

Oklahoma's devastating tornado, which killed at least 24 people and injured more than 200 others, is drawing comparisons to past U.S. twisters today, including the massive tornado that hit the same region in 1999. And the United States has plenty of examples to draw from. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States, in averaging more than 1,000 tornadoes each year, is by far the global leader when it comes to number of twisters recorded. Canada finishes a distant second with roughly 100 per year.
Here's NOAA's map of the regions of the world that are most likely to experience tornadoes. In addition to the United States and Canada, the organization highlights many European countries and parts of other nations including Argentina, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Japan (click on the image below to expand):
So why is the United States so disproportionately prone to tornadoes? According to a Discovery Channel explainer on the subject, the distinction is a result of climatology, geography, and topography (the NOAA image at the top of this post shows this week's storm system over Moore, Oklahoma):
[T]he United States has an  abundance of flat, low-lying geographic regions, and it also has a climate that  is conducive to intense thunderstorms, and tornadoes tend to form during  thunderstorms.
Turning for a moment from  topography to geography, the United States has a few places that might be  called tornado hotspots. Most prominent among them, of course, is "Tornado  Alley," a slice of America's mid-section running horizontally from Texas  up to North Dakota -- taking in portions of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,  Kansas and Nebraska....
Tornado alley's tornadoes  usually happen later in the spring time and sometimes into the fall. The region  is considered a prime breeding ground for supercell thunderstorms, which tend  to produce the strongest tornadoes. Supercell thunderstorms contain something  called a mesocyclone, which has a rotating updraft -- they're very dangerous  but also, when identified as supercells, can provide a good heads-up that the  extreme weather they can produce, like tornadoes, is possible....
Florida, too, has lots of  tornadoes. That's because the state has many thunderstorms on a daily basis,  and it's also a pit stop for many tropical storms or hurricanes (the tropical  storms and hurricanes don't tend to produce the kind of killer tornadoes that  come about during non-tropical storms).
While the United States leads the world when it comes to sheer volume of tornadoes, the ranking changes when you apply other filters. The United Kingdom, for example, has more tornadoes relative to its land area than any other country (a fact one expert attributed to the country's position on the Atlantic seaboard, at the nexus of polar air from the North Pole and tropical air from the Equator). And factors such as high population density, ineffective warning systems, and shoddy infrastructure mean tornadoes can be particularly deadly in countries like Bangladesh, which experienced a tornado that killed 1,300 people in 1989.
Writing for PBS , Peter Tyson points out that America's tornado tally may be so high relative to the rest of the world in part because other countries aren't as diligent about recording twisters. And he adds that all nations that experience tornadoes have something in common:
They lie 20° to 50° on either  side of the equator, in the mid-latitudes. "You could probably get a  tornado anywhere on the planet, but there are places where they are far less  frequent," says John Snow, a tornado expert at the University of Oklahoma. "For good meteorological reasons, these tend to be in the tropics and the  very high latitudes."
The only continent where twisters have yet to strike? Antarctica.

Abstract
Men are traditionally thought to have more problems in understanding women compared to understanding other men, though evidence supporting this assumption remains sparse. Recently, it has been shown, however, that meńs problems in recognizing women’s emotions could be linked to difficulties in extracting the relevant information from the eye region, which remain one of the richest sources of social information for the attribution of mental states to others. To determine possible differences in the neural correlates underlying emotion recognition from female, as compared to male eyes, a modified version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied to a sample of 22 participants. We found that men actually had twice as many problems in recognizing emotions from female as compared to male eyes, and that these problems were particularly associated with a lack of activation in limbic regions of the brain (including the hippocampus and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex). Moreover, men revealed heightened activation of the right amygdala to male stimuli regardless of condition (sex vs. emotion recognition). Thus, our findings highlight the function of the amygdala in the affective component of theory of mind (ToM) and in empathy, and provide further evidence that men are substantially less able to infer mental states expressed by women, which may be accompanied by sex-specific differences in amygdala activity.

Introduction
Sex differences in brain morphology and cognitive and affective functions have been increasingly documented [1] . One study has found that men have more problems in recognizing mental states and emotions in women than in men [2] , and it is still unclear why this could be. Other studies have found that relative to women men are faster in detecting angry male faces [3] . Some authors have suggested that same-sex facial expressions may be more important to males as compared to females [4] .
A so-called theory of mind (ToM) network and an empathy network of brain regions have been found to underlie the processes required to understand and share other people’s thoughts, feelings and intentions. The ToM network comprises of the following regions: the precuneus, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), temporal poles, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [5] , [6] , whereas the empathy network includes the following brain areas: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insula [7] . However, the amygdala, which is also implicated in face processing [8] , [9] , also seems to play an important role in emotional empathy [10] and affective ToM [11] .
Recent studies have suggested that deficits in recognizing facial emotions could be linked to difficulties in extracting the relevant information from the eye region (including gaze direction) [12] , which remains one of the richest sources of social information for the attribution of mental states to others. Recent evidence has further indicated that social cognitive processes such as face processing and mental state attribution continue to develop during adolescence [13] , and are due to genetic and/or hormonal (e.g. fetal testosterone) effects on brain maturation, which might develop distinctively in boys and girls [14] , [15] .
The Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test (RMET) is based on photographs of isolated eye regions, and has been developed for the evaluation of mentalizing capacities in adults [16] and children [17] . In this test, four words indicating an emotional mental state are presented and subjects are required to choose which one best describes the emotion expressed in the eye region. A recent study using this test in a sample of university students has shown that men performed better in recognizing emotions from male vs. female eyes under placebo vs. vasopressin administration [2] .
Based on these results, we expected that better performance in the recognition of emotions in male vs. female eyes would be related to differential (stronger) recruitment of networks underlying emotional empathy or affective ToM (i.e. the amygdala, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex) [7] , [10] . We examined a sample of healthy male participants using fMRI in combination with a modified version of the RMET [17] , which required both sex discrimination and emotion recognition of the same pairs of female and male eyes.
Materials and Methods
Participants
22 single men aged between 21 and 52 years (mean age: 35.6±10.0) old were recruited for participation through advertisements. All participants were right-handed, medically and psychiatrically healthy, and with an estimated IQ [18] greater than 80 (mean IQ: 109.8±12.1). None of the subjects had any history of psychiatric illness, significant physical medical conditions, or any other condition that would interfere with MRI scanning (e.g., extreme obesity, claustrophobia, cochlear implant, metal fragments in eyes, cardiac pacemaker, neural stimulator, and metallic body inclusions or other metal implanted in the body). Following initial screening, subjects were interviewed about their medical history. Furthermore, the SCID I [19] and II [20] were administered by an experienced psychiatrist trained to use these instruments.
The study was approved by the local Committee on Medical Ethics of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany and was performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). After a detailed description of the study was given to participants, written informed consent was obtained.
fMRI Task
A modified version of the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test” (RMET) [16] , [21] – [24] , was administered to all participants in the scanner. The RMET assesses the ability to infer other people’s mental states, using information from 36 pairs of eyes (black-and-white pictures of eighteen male and eighteen female eyes). All stimuli were of equal size (22×8 cm) and depicted twelve negative, eight positive and sixteen neutral expressions, counterbalanced for the sex of the eyes [25] .
Participants were asked to decide which of the two presented words (e.g., distrustful or terrified) best described the emotional/mental state of the person whose eyes were presented. The control condition comprised of a sex discrimination task in which for the same 36 pictures of eyes, the participants had to judge whether the eyes belonged to a man or woman. In total, the tasks consisted of 72 stimuli presented in a randomized (regarding stimuli within blocks and block order) block design with 12 blocks of six pairs of eyes. Participants responded via button press with their right index and middle fingers.
At the start of each block, the word “Emotion” or “Gender” was presented for seven seconds. The blocks assessing mental states were alternated with those assessing gender. Each picture was presented for eight seconds, and a question mark presented in the sixth second prompted the subjects to answer. Each block therefore lasted 48 seconds. Behavioral data were acquired with a button pad (Lumitouch™ Photon Control Inc, Burnaby, Canada). RMET scores were calculated as the percentage of correct discriminations over conditions, eye- type, and emotional valence as well as response times after the six-seconds period.
Data Acquisition
All MR images were obtained using a 1.5 T MR (Sonata, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard head coil. BOLD contrast images were acquired by applying an echo-planar acquisition technique (TR 3500 ms, TE 45 ms, flip angle 90°, FOV 240 mm, matrix 64) with 38 transversal slices (thickness 3.8×3.8×3 mm) and a 0.3 mm slice gap. Six initial “dummy” scans were eliminated prior to the data analysis to account for T1 relaxation effects.
Image Processing
We used SPM8 software ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ) for the analysis of the imaging data. Prior to second level statistical analyses, the images were realigned using sinc interpolation and normalized to the stereotactic template of the Montreal Neurological Institute ( http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging​/MniTalairach ). Bilinear interpolation was applied for normalization to the MNI-template. Normalized images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 9 mm FWHM. Single subject contrasts between experimental and control conditions were computed. The model consisted of a boxcar function convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the corresponding temporal derivative [26] . High-pass filtering with a cutoff frequency of 120 sec. and low-pass filtering with the HRF were applied.
Statistical Analysis
Behavioral data.
We performed a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two within subjects factors: (1) stimulus type (male eyes vs. female eyes) and (2) condition (emotion vs. gender recognition) in order to confirm that men had greater problems recognizing emotion than gender ( = main effect of condition) as well as to explore whether men reveal greater problems in recognizing emotions from female as compared to male eyes ( = condition x stimulus type interaction).
fMRI data.
We used the framework of the General Linear Model to perform a statistical group analysis on the fMRI data on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Analyses included five mutually exclusive trial covariates: correct emotion recognition from male and female eyes as well as correct gender recognition from male and female eyes and errors (either from emotion or gender recognition trials). Partial correlation maps for individual participants were generated, indicating the extent to which each voxel’s activity conformed to an a priori canonical double gamma hemodynamic response function. Between-condition contrasts (i.e., gender vs. emotion recognition for all stimuli as well as male and female eyes separately) were estimated on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a whole brain approach. T Maps of activations for emotion and gender recognition in male and female eyes were submitted to random-effects ANOVAs to test for the main effect of condition (activation on emotion recognition minus activation on gender recognition) the main effect of stimulus type (male vs. female eyes), and the condition by stimulus type interaction among all subjects. Similar to earlier studies [22] , [24] , statistical thresholds were set to p<.001, uncorrected at the voxel level (height threshold) and p<.05, corrected after Family Wise Error (FWE) at the cluster level (extent threshold) in all whole-brain analyses. To increase sensitivity for stimulus and condition x stimulus interaction effects, we performed small volume corrections (SVC), if differential activations in these regions were predicted by our a priori hypothesis. For this purpose ROIs within areas related to affective empathy (i.e. the amygdala, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex) were a priori defined by using the Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) [27] . Spherical volumes with a 10-mm radius were centered on the coordinates of the peak voxel within the a priori defined ROI. Significance thresholds for both height and extent were set to p<.05 FWE corrected for multiple comparisons as well as the number of ROIs (3×2) at the voxel level.
Regression models were calculated to assess the associations of age with differences in performance accuracy and activation pattern. Activations in regions showing significant group differences were extracted by volume of interest analyses (1steigenvariate) including all voxels of each cluster. Regression models were calculated step-wise with F probabilities of <.05 to enter and >.1 to remove variables. Multi co-linearity was tested by calculating the squared multiple correlation (R2) of predictor variables.
Results
As illustrated in Fig. 1a , men exhibited significantly greater problems recognizing emotion than gender (main effect of condition: F1,21 = 39.5; p<.001). Furthermore, they showed greater problems recognizing emotions from female compared to male eyes (condition x stimulus-type interaction: F1,21 = 24.1; p<.001). The same result was found for the reaction time measures ( Fig. 1b ). Men exhibited significantly longer reaction times when recognizing emotions than gender (main effect of condition: F1,21 = 16.0; p<.001) and the RT differences (emotion – gender recognition) were significantly larger for female than male eyes (condition x stimulus-type interaction: F1,21 = 4.5; p = .042). To confirm that differences in the ability to recognize emotions from male and female eyes were not affected by emotional valence of stimuli, an additional two (male vs. female eyes) by three (negative vs. positive vs. neutral expressions) ANOVA was performed. Neither a significant main effect for emotional valence (F1,21 = 0.54; p = .819) nor a significant eyes type by emotional valence interaction (F1,21 = 2.83; p = .107) could be detected.

COMMAND PERFORMANCE
A border collie named Chaser participates in an experiment testing her ability to understand commands given before she can see any of the objects named in those directives. After hearing a four-word command, Chaser consistently turned around and carried the correct item from the head of the bed to the living room, where she placed it next the appropriate object.

Chaser isn’t just a 9-year-old border collie with her breed’s boundless energy, intense focus and love of herding virtually anything. She’s a grammar hound.
In experiments directed by her owner, psychologist John Pilley of Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C., Chaser demonstrated her grasp of the basic elements of grammar by responding correctly to commands such as “to ball take Frisbee” and its reverse, “to Frisbee take ball.” The dog had previous, extensive training to recognize classes of words including nouns, verbs and prepositions.
“Chaser intuitively discovered how to comprehend sentences based on lots of background learning about different types of words,” Pilley says. He reports the results May 13 in Learning and Motivation.
Throughout the first three years of Chaser’s life, Pilley and a colleague trained the dog to recognize and fetch more than 1,000 objects by name. Using praise and play as reinforcements, the researchers also taught Chaser the meaning of different types of words, such as verbs and prepositions. As a result, Chaser learned that phrases such as “to Frisbee” meant that she should take whatever was in her mouth to the named object.
Exactly how the dog gained her command of grammar is unclear, however. Pilley suspects that Chaser first mentally linked each of two nouns she heard in a sentence to objects in her memory. Then the canine held that information in mind while deciding which of two objects to bring to which of two other objects.
Pilley’s work follows controversial studies of grammar understanding in dolphins and a pygmy chimp.
It’s hard to know what a dog or other nonhuman animal is actually thinking about when responding to commands, comments dog researcher and psychology graduate student Krista Macpherson of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada. Debate about whether these animals understand that the meaning of commands rests on abstract rules will continue with Chaser’s behavior, in her view.
Chaser started sentence training at age 7. She stood facing a pair of objects she knew by name. An experimenter would say, for instance, “to ball take Frisbee.” In initial trials, the experimenter pointed at each item while saying its name.
After several weeks of training, two experiments conducted in Pilley’s living room tested Chaser’s grammar knowledge. A college student sat with the dog facing two pairs of objects. Chaser had to choose an object from one pair to carry to an object from the other pair. The student read commands that included words for those objects. Only some of those words had been used during sentence training, including “to sugar take decoy.” To see whether Chaser grasped that grammar could be used flexibly, Pilley had the student also read sentences in the reversed form of “take sugar to decoy.” In 28 of 40 attempts, Chaser grabbed the correct item in her mouth and dropped it next to the correct target.
Another experiment tested Chaser’s ability to understand commands when she couldn’t see the objects at first. Pilley stood at the end of a bed where Chaser sat facing him, with two objects behind her at the other end of the bed. After hearing a command, Chaser turned around and nabbed one of the objects. She then ran to the living room and delivered the item to one of another pair of objects. She succeeded on all 12 trials.
Border collies achieve similar grammatical insights when working with farmers to learn sheep-herding commands, Pilley speculates. With enough training, other dog breeds could also get a paw-hold on grammar, he predicts.

RICHLAND, Wash. – A new analysis shows that the nation's land and water resources could likely support the growth of enough algae to produce up to 25 billion gallons of algae-based fuel a year in the United States, one-twelfth of the country's yearly needs.
The findings come from an in-depth look at the water resources that would be needed to grow significant amounts of algae in large, specially built shallow ponds. The results were published in the May 7 issue of Environmental Science and Technology, published by the American Chemical Society.
"While there are many details still to be worked out, we don't see water issues as a deal breaker for the development of an algae biofuels industry in many areas of the country," said first author Erik Venteris of the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
For the best places to produce algae for fuel, think hot, humid and wet. Especially promising are the Gulf Coast and the Southeastern seaboard.
"The Gulf Coast offers a good combination of warm temperatures, low evaporation, access to an abundance of water, and plenty of fuel-processing facilities," said hydrologist Mark Wigmosta, the leader of the team that did the analysis.
Wooing algae as fuel
Algae, it turns out, are plump with oil, and several research teams and companies are pursuing ways to improve the creation of biofuels based on algae — growing algae composed of more oil, creating algae that live longer and thrive in cooler temperatures, or devising new ways to separate out the useful oil from the rest of the algae.
But first, simply, the algae must grow. The chief requirements are sunlight and water. Antagonists include clouds, a shortage of water, and evaporation.
A previous report by the same team looked mainly at how much demand algae farms would create for freshwater. That report demonstrated that oil based on algae have the potential to replace a significant portion of the nation's oil imports and drew the attention of President Obama .
The new report focuses on actual water supplies and looks at a range of possible sources of water, including fresh groundwater, salty or saline groundwater, and seawater. The team estimates that up to 25 billion gallons of algal oil could be produced annually, an increase of 4 billion gallons over the previous study's estimate. The new amount is enough to fill the nation's current oil needs for one month — about 600 million barrels — each year. The study's authors note that the new estimate is exactly that — an estimate — based to some degree on assumptions about land and water availability and use.
"I'm confident that algal biofuels can be part of the solution to our energy needs, but algal biofuels certainly aren't the whole solution," said Wigmosta. Most important, he notes that the cost of making the fuel far exceeds the cost of traditional gasoline-based products right now.
Big ponds, big potential
An algae farm would likely consist of many ponds, with water maybe six to 15 inches deep. A few companies have built smaller algae farms and are just beginning to churn out huge amounts of algae to convert to fuel; earlier this year, one company sold algae-based oil to customers in California. Players in the algae biofuels arena range from Exxon-Mobil, which launched a $600 million research effort four years ago, to this year's teenage winner of the Intel Science Talent Search, who was recognized for her work developing algae that produce more oil than they normally do.
The availability of water has been one of the biggest concerns regarding the adoption of broad-scale production of algal biofuel. Scientists estimate that fuel created with algae would use much more water than industrial processes used to harness energy from oil, wind, sunlight, or most other forms of raw energy. To produce 25 billion gallons of algae oil, the team estimates that the process annually would require the equivalent of about one-quarter of the amount of water that is now used each year in the entire United States for agriculture. While that is a huge amount, the team notes that the water would come from a multitude of sources: fresh groundwater, salty groundwater, and seawater.
For its analysis, the team limited the amount of freshwater that could be drawn in any one area, assuming that no more than 5 percent of a given watershed's mean annual water flow could be used in algae production. That number is a starting point, says Venteris, who notes that it's the same percentage that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows power plants to use for cooling.
"In arid areas such as the Desert Southwest, 5 percent is probably an overstatement of the amount of water available, but in many other areas that are a lot wetter, such as much of the East, it's likely that much more water would be available," says Venteris.
"While the nation's Desert Southwest has been considered a possible site for vast algae growth using saline water, rapid evaporation in this region make success there more challenging for low- cost production," Venteris added.
Venteris and colleagues weighed the pluses and minuses of the various water sources. They note that freshwater is cheap but in very limited supply in many areas. Saline groundwater is attractive because it's widely available but usually at a much deeper depth, requiring more equipment and technology to pump it to the surface and make it suitable for algae production. Seawater is plentiful, but would require much more infrastructure, most notably the creation of pipelines to move the water from the coast to processing plants.
The team notes that special circumstances, such as particularly tight water restrictions in some areas or severe drought or above-average rainfall in others, could affect its estimates of water availability.
The work was funded by the DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In addition to Venteris and Wigmosta, PNNL scientists Richard Skaggs and Andre Coleman contributed to the project and authored the study.

Duke University engineers have developed a novel method for producing clean hydrogen, which could prove essential to weaning society off of fossil fuels and their environmental implications.
While hydrogen is ubiquitous in the environment, producing and collecting molecular hydrogen for transportation and industrial uses is expensive and complicated. Just as importantly, a byproduct of most current methods of producing hydrogen is carbon monoxide, which is toxic to humans and animals.
The Duke engineers, using a new catalytic approach, have shown in the laboratory that they can reduce carbon monoxide levels to nearly zero in the presence of hydrogen and the harmless byproducts of carbon dioxide and water. They also demonstrated that they could produce hydrogen by reforming fuel at much lower temperatures than conventional methods, which makes it a more practical option.
Catalysts are agents added to promote chemical reactions. In this case, the catalysts were nanoparticle combinations of gold and iron oxide (rust), but not in the traditional sense. Current methods depend on gold nanoparticles' ability to drive the process as the sole catalyst, while the Duke researchers made both the iron oxide and the gold the focus of the catalytic process.
The study appears online in the Journal of Catalysis.
"Our ultimate goal is to be able to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells," said Titilayo "Titi" Shodiya, a graduate student working in the laboratory of senior researcher Nico Hotz, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering. "Everyone is interested in sustainable and non-polluting ways of producing useful energy without fossil fuels," said Shodiya, the paper's first author.
Fuel cells produce electricity through chemical reactions, most commonly involving hydrogen. Also, many industrial processes require hydrogen as a chemical reagent and vehicles are beginning to use hydrogen as a primary fuel source .
"We were able through our system to consistently produce hydrogen with less than 0.002 percent (20 parts per million) of carbon monoxide," Shodiya said.
The Duke researchers achieved these levels by switching the recipe for the nanoparticles used as catalysts for the reactions to oxidize carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich gases. Traditional methods of cleaning hydrogen, which are not nearly as efficient as this new approach, also involve gold-iron oxide nanoparticles as the catalyst, the researchers said.
"It had been assumed that the iron oxide nanoparticles were only 'scaffolds' holding the gold nanoparticles together, and that the gold was responsible for the chemical reactions ," Sodiya said. "However, we found that increasing the surface area of the iron oxide dramatically increased the catalytic activity of the gold."
One of the newest approaches to producing renewable energy is the use of biomass-derived alcohol-based sources, such as methanol. When methanol is treated with steam, or reformed, it creates a hydrogen-rich mixture that can be used in fuel cells.
"The main problem with this approach is that it also produces carbon monoxide, which is not only toxic to life, but also quickly damages the catalyst on fuel cell membranes that are crucial to the functioning of a fuel cell ," Hotz said. "It doesn't take much carbon monoxide to ruin these membranes."
The researchers ran the reaction for more than 200 hours and found no reduction in the ability of the catalyst to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide in the hydrogen gas.
"The mechanism for this is not exactly understood yet. However, while current thinking is that the size of the gold particles is key, we believe the emphasis of further research should focus on iron oxide 's role in the process," Shodiya said.

A new waterproof fabric developed by bioengineers at the University of California, Davis, could help prevent embarrassing sweat stains even during the most intense of workouts and hottest of days.
According to the inventors, unlike more common fabrics such as cotton, which wicks away sweat during light exercise but becomes soaked and clingy as the tempo increases, their fabric works like human skin in that it forms excess sweat into droplets that drain away by themselves.
To do this, the textile uses hydrophilic, or water-attracting, threads stitched into a highly water-repellent fabric in patterns that then suck the droplets of water from one side of the fabric, transport them along the threads and expel them from the other side.

This system, in turn, enables the researchers to change the direction the water is channeled simply by changing the thread patterns.
However, it’s not just the threads conducting the water: the water-repellent properties of the surrounding fabric also help to drive water down the channels.
What’s more, unlike fabrics available today, the water-pumping effect keeps working even when its fibers are saturated – a feat accomplished by the sustaining pressure gradient produced by the surface tension of droplets.
By directing the flow of moisture, the engineers are then able to keep the rest of the fabric dry and breathable.
Eventually, the researchers hope to see the fabric put to use by manufacturers of exercise clothing lines.
“We intentionally did not use any fancy microfabrication techniques so it is compatible with the textile manufacturing process and very easy to scale up,” Siyuan Xing, the lead graduated student on the project, said.

In the June 2006 issue of Science, two independent teams of physicists simultaneously presented blueprints for an invisibility cloak. One team included David                            Smith from Duke University and John Pendry from Imperial College London ( 1 ), and the other was led by Ulf Leonhardt from St. Andrews University in Scotland ( 2 ). The idea wasn't new—scientists have been pondering how to disappear since electromagnetic radiation was discovered, and                            philosophers even longer—but the studies showed how to make the fantastic a reality. The two designs differed in execution                            but shared a core idea: anything can be hidden in plain sight if light can be guided around it like water flowing around a                            pebble in a stream.
Of course, that's a big “if.” Those first successes arrived thanks to the advent of metamaterials, laboratory-engineered wonderstuff                            that can influence waves in ways that natural materials cannot. A metamaterial gets its properties from how it is made, rather                            than its content. The material comprises repeated, periodic structures, like an artificial crystal, but with features smaller                            than the waves it is designed to influence. These elements give the device a negative refractive index, which means the sum                            effect is to bend light in the opposite direction than natural light-permeable substances like water, glass, or air. Nothing                            in nature has a negative refractive index. With the right design, a metamaterial cloak coaxes waves of light around an object and then brings them back together seamlessly.
The first successful cloak, built by the Duke team and unveiled in October 2006 ( 3 ), used concentric rings of metamaterials to shield a small copper cylinder from a small band of incoming microwaves. As radiation                            goes, microwaves are big, with wavelengths as short as a few millimeters or as long as a meter. A metamaterial cloak that                            hides objects from visible light, with much shorter wavelengths, will require much smaller elements. However, researchers                            are inching closer. In 2011, engineers from the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrated a visible light “carpet cloak”                            that can hide an object about the size of a small bacterium ( 4 ). In late 2012, Duke engineers rolled out a new cloak that improves upon their original design ( 5 ).
Researchers have begun to branch out from light, as well, and anything that travels as a wave has become fair game. Because                            sound travels as a wave, engineers hypothesized an acoustic analog of the invisibility cloak that might, for example, hide                            an object from sonar or correct for acoustic “dead zones” in concert halls. Acoustic cloaks might be constructed from sonic                            crystals, which are constructed devices that block sound waves of selected frequencies. In March 2013, José Sánchez-Dehesa                            from the Polytechnic Institute of Valencia, Spain, introduced an acoustic cloak—the first in three dimensions—printed on a                            3D printer ( 6 ). Other researchers are thinking even bigger. Shields made from large-scale metamaterials might protect vulnerable shorelines                            or oilrigs from deadly tsunamis by sending the wave away. Along those same lines, seismic shields buried in the ground could                            theoretically protect buildings from the destructive vibrations of earthquakes.

(AFP) – 14 hours ago 
PARIS — Scientists said Tuesday they had managed to kill lab-grown tuberculosis (TB) bacteria with good old Vitamin C -- an "unexpected" discovery they hope will lead to better, cheaper drugs.
A team from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York made the accidental find while researching how TB bacteria become resistant to the TB drug isoniazid.
The researchers added isoniazid and a "reducing agent" known as cysteine to the TB in a test tube, expecting the bacteria to develop drug resistance.
Instead, the team "ended up killing off the culture", according to the study's senior author William Jacobs, who said the result was "totally unexpected".
Reducing agents chemically reduce other substances.
The team then replaced the cysteine in the experiment with another reducing agent -- Vitamin C.
It, too, killed the bacteria.
"I was in disbelief," said Jacobs of the outcome published in the journal Nature Communications.
"Even more surprisingly... when we left out the TB drug isoniazid and just had Vitamin C alone, we discovered that Vitamin C kills tuberculosis."
The team next tested the vitamin on drug resistant strains of TB, with the same outcome.
In the lab tests, the bacteria never developed resistance to Vitamin C -- "almost like the dream drug", Jacobs said in a video released by the college.
He stressed the effect had only been demonstrated in a test tube so far, and "we don't know if it will work in humans", or which dose might be useful.
"But in fact before this study we wouldn't have even thought about trying this study in humans."
In March, disease experts warned of a "very real" risk of an untreatable TB strain emerging as more and more people develop drug resistance.
In 2011, there were believed to be some 12 million TB cases in total -- 630,000 of them of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) variety which does not respond to the most potent drugs -- isoniazid and rifampin.
Extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB, does not respond to an even wider range of drugs.
TB was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) 20 years ago, but remains a leading cause of death by an infectious disease despite a 41-percent drop in the death rate from 1990 to 2011.
In 2011, 8.7 million people fell ill with TB and 1.4 million died, said the WHO.
Over 95 percent of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and it is a leading killer of people with HIV.
An airborne disease of the lungs, tuberculosis is usually treatable with a six-month course of antibiotics.
Resistance to TB drugs develops when treatment fails to kill the bacteria that causes it -- either because the patient fails to follow their prescribed dosages or the drug doesn't work.
It can also be contracted through rare forms of the disease that are directly transmissible from person to person.
MDR TB in the United States can cost as much as $250,000 (200,000 euros) per patient to treat.
XDR TB requires about two years of treatment with even more expensive drugs that cause side-effects and offer no guarantee of a cure.
The authors of the new study urged further research into the potential uses of Vitamin C in TB treatment, stressing it was "inexpensive, widely available and very safe to use."
"This would be a great study to consider because we have strains of tuberculosis that we don't have drugs for, and I know in the laboratory that we can kill those strains with Vitamin C," said Jacobs.

UofL scientists uncover how grapefruits provide a secret weapon in medical drug delivery
LOUISVILLE, Ky. � Grapefruits have long been known for their health benefits, and the subtropical fruit may revolutionize how medical therapies like anti-cancer drugs are delivered to specific tumor cells.
University of Louisville researchers have uncovered how to create nanoparticles using natural lipids derived from grapefruit, and have discovered how to use them as drug delivery vehicles. UofL scientists Huang-Ge Zhang, D.V.M., Ph.D., Qilong Wang, Ph.D., and their team today (May 21, 2013), published their findings in Nature Communications.
"These nanoparticles, which we've named grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNVs), are derived from an edible plant, and we believe they are less toxic for patients, result in less biohazardous waste for the environment, and are much cheaper to produce at large scale than nanoparticles made from synthetic materials," Zhang said.
The researchers demonstrated that GNVs can transport various therapeutic agents, including anti-cancer drugs, DNA/RNA and proteins such as antibodies. Treatment of animals with GNVs seemed to cause less adverse effects than treatment with drugs encapsulated in synthetic lipids.
"Our GNVs can be modified to target specific cells � we can use them like missiles to carry a variety of therapeutic agents for the purpose of destroying diseased cells," he said. "Furthermore, we can do this at an affordable price."
The therapeutic potential of grapefruit derived nanoparticles was further validated through a Phase 1 clinical trial for treatment of colon cancer patients. So far, researchers have observed no toxicity in the patients who orally took the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin encapsulated in grapefruit nanoparticles.
The UofL scientists also plan to test whether this technology can be applied in the treatment of inflammation related autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
A Common Sense Approach
Zhang said he began this research by considering how our ancestors selected food to eat.
"The fruits and vegetables we buy from the grocery today were passed down from generation to generation as favorable and nutritious for the human body. On the flip side, outcomes were not favorable for our ancestors who ate poisonous mushrooms, for example," he said. "It made sense for us to consider eatable plants as a mechanism to create medical nanoparticles as a potential non-toxic therapeutic delivery vehicle."
In addition to grapefruit, Zhang and his team analyzed the nanoparticles from tomatoes and grapes. Grapefruits were chosen for further exploration because a larger quantity of lipids can be derived from this fruit.

Mummified Man, Bundled Baby Change View of Ancient Burials in Texas
More  than 10 elaborately prepared bodies recovered from caves in West Texas  could rewrite the history of how people processed, buried, and even  thought about the dead in the ancient Southwest, according to a new study.
Some of the  remains, dating back as much as 4,000 years, were naturally mummified by  the arid climate, leaving traces of skin, hair and internal tissues  intact. Others were ritually “bundled,” a practice that involved flexing  the deceased into a fetal position, wrapping it in a series of woven  mats, and sometimes binding it with ropes made from human hair.

One  set of remains, unearthed from a cave known as Mummy Shelter, was of an  exceptionally well mummified adult male, and is at least 800 years  older than was previously thought, dating back some 1,900 years.
Another  set, of a one-year-old child, is the most ornate infant burial found in  the region and has been dated at 3,800 years old -- the oldest example  of bundling ever studied, according to the research, published recently  in the journal Plains Anthropologist .
The  baby was interred in a rockshelter with a host of elaborate grave goods, including four  ornaments carved out of mussel shells, pipes made from hollow reeds, and  finely woven baskets that contained two tiny skull caps, braided out of  natural fiber and affectionately painted in red diamond and zigzag  patterns.
Other  bodies, removed from caves near where the Pecos River meets the  Texas-Mexico border, have been found with baskets full of spare clothing  and even food, suggesting that the dead were being outfitted for the  afterlife.
Though  not widely known today, except to archaeologists and relic hunters,  these practices appear to have been common for a millennium or more  among a nexus of cultures known simply as the Lower Pecos.
But Dr. Solveig Turpin , an anthropologist at the University of Texas at  Austin who conducted the research, says her study -- particularly of the  festooned infant -- pushes back the use of these customs by at least a  thousand years.

She  conducted radiocarbon dating on 11 bundled burials from the Lower Pecos  region, taking samples from the fiber wrappings. Of those samples, 9  turned out to be 1,300 to 2,300 years old, dating to the end of a period  known as the Late Archaic, when experts generally agree that such  fastidious funerary practices were more common.
But  tests of the infant bundle dated it to 3,800 years ago, more than a  millennium earlier than expected. The results were so unusual that  Turpin conducted the tests twice.
“I  was surprised by the first [result] because it was older than the other  baby [remains’] dates, so I ran a second sample,” she told Western Digs  by email.
As  for the mummified man from Mummy Cave, “I tend to accept the new date because  it puts it in the same time period as the other adult bundles.”
Much  of what we know about the Lower Pecos comes largely from burials like  these, and the thousands of pictographs found on rocks throughout the region.  Rather than a single, coherent civilization, the region may have seen a  continuum of cultures, beginning around 9,000 years ago and culminating  in historic times with the absorption of its heritage into the tribes of  south Texas and Northern Mexico.

The  remains studied by Turpin had been excavated decades ago, over a period  of 50 years. Some had been looted by relic hunters and kept in private  collections and museums; others were professionally excavated in the  1930s. By tracking down the far-flung remains, Turpin was able to create  a comprehensive record of Lower Pecos life, and death.
Taken  together, the new dates illustrate a pattern in which these complex  burial patterns waxed and waned over time. Turpin theorizes that the  customs may have fluctuated with the climate -- during cooler, wetter  periods when the grasslands extended into ancient South Texas, so too  came the Plains hunters and their customs.
And  when the region returned to the arid landscape like the one we know  today, living -- and bundling the dead -- in dry rockshelters also  regained favor, a lifeway of a desert culture.
There’s  still much left to learn about the Lower Pecos people, Turpin said: “There are other bundles that should and could be dated.”

Scientists have pinpointed a catalytic trigger for the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, establishing the pathway that shows how the toxic species that cause cell death, the oligomers, are formed.
Researchers have pinpointed a catalytic trigger for the onset of Alzheimer’s disease – when the fundamental structure of a protein molecule changes to cause a chain reaction that leads to the death of neurons in the brain.
For the first time, scientists at Cambridge’s Department of Chemistry have been able to map in detail the pathway that generates “aberrant” forms of proteins which are at the root of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s.
They believe the breakthrough is a vital step closer to increased capabilities for earlier diagnosis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and opens up possibilities for a new generation of targeted drugs, as scientists say they have uncovered the earliest stages of the development of Alzheimer’s that drugs could possibly target.
The study, published today in the journal PNAS, is a milestone in the long-term research established in Cambridge by Professor Christopher Dobson and his colleagues, following the realization by Dobson of the underlying nature of protein ‘misfolding’ and its connection with disease over 15 years ago.
The research is likely to have a central role to play in diagnostic and drug development for dementia-related diseases, which are increasingly prevalent and damaging as populations live longer.
“There are no disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s and dementia at the moment, only limited treatment for symptoms. We have to solve what happens at the molecular level before we can progress and have real impact,” said Dr Tuomas Knowles, lead author of the study and long-time collaborator of Professor Dobson.
“We’ve now established the pathway that shows how the toxic species that cause cell death, the oligomers, are formed. This is the key pathway to detect, target and intervene – the molecular catalyst that underlies the pathology.”
In 2010, the Alzheimer’s Research Trust showed that dementia costs the UK economy over £23 billion, more than cancer and heart disease combined. Just last week, PM David Cameron urged scientists and clinicians to work together to “improve treatments and find scientific breakthroughs” to address “one of the biggest social and healthcare challenges we face.”
The neurodegenerative process giving rise to diseases such as Alzheimer’s is triggered when the normal structures of protein molecules within cells become corrupted.
Protein molecules are made in cellular ‘assembly lines’ that join together chemical building blocks called amino acids in an order encoded in our DNA. New proteins emerge as long, thin chains that normally need to be folded into compact and intricate structures to carry out their biological function.
Under some conditions, however, proteins can ‘misfold’ and snag surrounding normal proteins, which then tangle and stick together in clumps which build to masses, frequently millions, of malfunctioning molecules that shape themselves into unwieldy protein tendrils.
The abnormal tendril structures, called ‘amyloid fibrils’, grow outwards around the location where the focal point, or ‘nucleation’ of these abnormal “species” occurs.
Amyloid fibrils can form the foundations of huge protein deposits – or plaques – long-seen in the brains of Alzheimer’s sufferers, and once believed to be the cause of the disease, before the discovery of ‘toxic oligomers’ by Dobson and others a decade or so ago.
A plaque’s size and density renders it insoluble, and consequently unable to move. Whereas the oligomers, which give rise to Alzheimer’s disease, are small enough to spread easily around the brain – killing neurons and interacting harmfully with other molecules – but how they were formed was until now a mystery.
The new work, in large part carried out by researcher Samuel Cohen, shows that once a small but critical level of malfunctioning protein ‘clumps’ have formed, a runaway chain reaction is triggered that multiplies exponentially the number of these protein composites, activating new focal points through ‘nucleation’.
It is this secondary nucleation process that forges juvenile tendrils, initially consisting of clusters that contain just a few protein molecules. Small and highly diffusible, these are the ‘toxic oligomers’ that careen dangerously around the brain cells, killing neurons and ultimately causing loss of memory and other symptoms of dementia.
The researchers brought together kinetic experiments with a theoretical framework based on master equations, tools commonly used in other areas of chemistry and physics but had not been exploited to their full potential in the study of protein malfunction before.
The latest research follows hard on the heels of another ground breaking study, published in April of this year again in PNAS, in which the Cambridge group, in Collaboration with Colleagues in London and at MIT, worked out the first atomic structure of one of the damaging amyloid fibril protein tendrils. They say the years spent developing research techniques are really paying off now, and they are starting to solve “some of the key mysteries” of these neurodegenerative diseases.
“We are essentially using a physical and chemical methods to address a biomolecular problem, mapping out the networks of processes and dominant mechanisms to ‘recreate the crime scene’ at the molecular root of Alzheimer’s disease,” explained Knowles.
“Increasingly, using quantitative experimental tools and rigorous theoretical analysis to understand complex biological processes are leading to exciting and game-changing results. With a disease like Alzheimer’s, you have to intervene in a highly specific manner to prevent the formation of the toxic agents. Now we’ve found how the oligomers are created, we know what process we need to turn off.”

Resistance to last-line antibiotic also makes bacteria resistant to immune attacks
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is bad enough, but what if drug resistance also gives bacteria the ability to fend off attacks by the immune system? In an Observation piece in mBio this week
scientists identify a lose-lose situation with the antibiotic colistin and Acinetobacter baumannii: bacteria resistant to colistin are also commonly resistant to antimicrobial substances made by the human body. Cross-resistance to colistin and host antimicrobials LL-37 and lysozyme, which help defend the body against bacterial attack, could mean that patients with life-threatening multi-drug resistant infections are also saddled with a crippled immune response.
A Fifty Year Old Drug
Colistin is a last-line drug for treating several kinds of drug-resistant infections, but colistin resistance and the drug's newfound impacts on bacterial resistance to immune attack underscore the need for newer, better antibiotics, says corresponding author David Weiss of Emory University.
Weiss says the results show that colistin therapy can fail patients in two ways. "The way that the bacteria become resistant [to colistin] allows them to also become resistant to the antimicrobials made by our immune system. That is definitely not what doctors want to do when they're treating patients with this last line antibiotic," says Weiss.
Although it was developed fifty years ago, colistin remains in use today not so much because it's particularly safe or effective, but because the choices for treating multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and other resistant infections are few and dwindling. Colistin is used when all or almost all other drugs have failed, often representing a patient's last hope for survival.
Drug Action Works Like Immune Proteins
Weiss says he and his colleagues noted that colistin works by disrupting the inner and outer membranes that hold Gram-negative bacterial cells together, much the same way LL-37 and lysozyme do. LL-37 is a protein found at sites of inflammation, whereas lysozyme is found in numerous different immune cells and within secretions like tears, breast milk, and mucus, and both are important defenses against invading bacteria. Weiss and his collaborators from Emory, the CDC, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta set out to find whether resistance to colistin could engender resistance to attack by LL-37 or lysozyme.
Looking at A. baumannii isolates from patients around the country, they noted that all the colistin-resistant strains harbored mutations in pmrB, a regulatory gene that leads to the modification of polysaccharides on the outside of the cell in response to antibiotic exposure. Tests showed a tight correlation between the ability of individual isolates to resist high concentrations of colistin and the ability to resist attacks by LL-37 or lysozyme.
Patient Isolates Provide Causative Evidence
This was very convincing, write the authors, that mutations in the pmrB gene were responsible for cross-resistance to LL-37 and lysozyme, but to get closer to a causative link between treatment and cross-resistance, they studied two pairs of A. baumannii isolates taken from two different patients before and after they were treated for three or six weeks with colistin. The results helped confirm the cross-resistance link: neither strain taken before treatment was resistant to colistin, LL-37, or lysozyme, but the strains taken after treatment showed significant resistance to colistin and lysozyme. (One post-colistin isolate was no more or less resistant to LL-37 than its paired pre-colistin isolate.) Like the resistant strains tested earlier, both post-colistin isolates harbored crucial mutations in the pmrB gene that apparently bestow the ability to resist treatment.
The authors point out that the apparent link between resistance to colistin and cross-resistance to antimicrobial agents of the immune system could well extend to other pathogens that are treated with colistin, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Weiss says he plans to follow up with studies to determine whether this bears out.
More Funding Needed for Antibiotic R&D
For Weiss, the problems with colistin are symptomatic of a much larger trio of problems: increasing levels of drug resistance, cuts in federal funding for antibiotic research, and lack of incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in antibiotic R&D. "We don’t have enough antibiotics, and it's really important for the research community and the public to support increases in funding for research to develop new antibiotics," says Weiss.
"We got complacent for a while and the bugs are becoming resistant. This is something we can reverse - or make a lot better - if we have the resources."

http://phys.org/news/2013-05-human-culture-linked-rapid-climate.html|Origins of human culture linked to rapid climate change
May 21, Space & Earth/Earth Sciences
Rapid climate change during the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, during the Middle Stone Age, sparked surges in cultural innovation in early modern human populations, according to new research.
The research, published this month in Nature Communications, was conducted by a team of scientists from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, the Natural History Museum in London and the University of Barcelona.
The scientists studied a marine sediment core off the coast of South Africa and reconstructed terrestrial climate variability over the last 100,000 years.
Dr Martin Ziegler, Cardiff University School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: "We found that South Africa experienced rapid climate transitions toward wetter conditions at times when the Northern Hemisphere experienced extremely cold conditions."
These large Northern Hemisphere cooling events have previously been linked to a change in the Atlantic Ocean circulation that led to a reduced transport of warm water to the high latitudes in the North. In response to this Northern Hemisphere cooling, large parts of the sub-Saharan Africa experienced very dry conditions.
"Our new data however, contrasts with sub-Saharan Africa and demonstrates that the South African climate responded in the opposite direction, with increasing rainfall, that can be associated with a globally occurring southward shift of the tropical monsoon belt."
Linking climate change with human evolution
Professor Ian Hall, Cardiff University School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: "When the timing of these rapidly occurring wet pulses was compared with the archaeological datasets, we found remarkable coincidences.
"The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall."
"Similarly, the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions."
Professor Chris Stringer of London's Natural History Museum commented "The correspondence between climatic ameliorations and cultural innovations supports the view that population growth fuelled cultural changes, through increased human interactions."
The South African archaeological record is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern behavior in early humans. This includes the use of symbols, which has been linked to the development of complex language, and personal adornments made of seashells.
"The quality of the southern African data allowed us to make these correlations between climate and behavioural change, but it will require comparable data from other areas before we can say whether this region was uniquely important in the development of modern human culture" added Professor Stringer.
The new study presents the most convincing evidence so far that abrupt climate change was instrumental in this development.

Rice University scientists have unveiled a robust new method for arranging metal nanoparticles in geometric patterns that can act as optical processors that transform incoming light signals into output of a different color. The breakthrough by a team of theoretical and applied physicists and engineers at Rice's Laboratory for Nanophotonics (LANP) is described this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Rice's team used the method to create an optical device in which incoming light could be directly controlled with light via a process known as "four-wave mixing." Four-wave mixing has been widely studied, but Rice's disc-patterning method is the first that can produce materials that are tailored to perform four-wave mixing with a wide range of colored inputs and outputs.
"Versatility is one of the advantages of this process," said study co-author Naomi Halas, director of LANP and Rice's Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a professor of biomedical engineering, chemistry, physics and astronomy. "It allows us to mix colors in a very general way. That means not only can we send in beams of two different colors and get out a third color, but we can fine-tune the arrangements to create devices that are tailored to accept or produce a broad spectrum of colors."
The information processing that takes place inside today's computers, smartphones and tablets is electronic. Each of the billions of transistors in a computer chip uses electrical inputs to act upon and modify the electrical signals passing through it. Processing information with light instead of electricity could allow for computers that are both faster and more energy-efficient, but building an optical computer is complicated by the quantum rules that light obeys.

"In most circumstances, one beam of light won't interact with another," said LANP theoretical physicist Peter Nordlander, a co-author of the new study. "For instance, if you shine a flashlight at a wall and you cross that beam with the beam from a second flashlight, it won't matter. The light that comes out of the first flashlight will pass through, independent of the light from the second.
"This changes if the light is traveling in a 'nonlinear medium,'" he said. "The electromagnetic properties of a nonlinear medium are such that the light from one beam will interact with another. So, if you shine the two flashlights through a nonlinear medium, the intensity of the beam from the first flashlight will be reduced proportionally to the intensity of the second beam."

The patterns of metal discs LANP scientists created for the PNAS study are a type of nonlinear media. The team used electron-beam lithography to etch puck-shaped gold discs that were placed on a transparent surface for optical testing. The diameter of each disc was about one-thousandth the width of a human hair. Each was designed to harvest the energy from a particular frequency of light; by arranging a dozen of the discs in a closely spaced pattern, the team was able to enhance the nonlinear properties of the system by creating intense electrical fields.
"Our system exploits a particular plasmonic effect called a Fano resonance to boost the efficiency of the relatively weak nonlinear effect that underlies four-wave mixing," Nordlander said. "The result is a boost in the intensity of the third color of light that the device produces."
Graduate student and co-author Yu-Rong Zhen calculated the precise arrangement of 12 discs that would be required to produce two coherent Fano resonances in a single device, and graduate student and lead co-author Yu Zhang created the device that produced the four-wave mixing—the first such material ever created.
"The device Zhang created for four-wave mixing is the most efficient yet produced for that purpose, but the value of this research goes beyond the design for this particular device," said Halas, who was recently named a member of the National Academy of Sciences for her pioneering research in nanophotonics.

The Amazon rain forest, popularly known as the lungs of the planet, inhales carbon dioxide as it exudes oxygen. Plants use carbon dioxide from the air to grow parts that eventually fall to the ground to decompose or get washed away by the region’s plentiful rainfall.

The team used rented boats to collect samples in the mouth of the world’s largest river.
Until recently people believed much of the rain forest’s carbon floated down the Amazon River and ended up deep in the ocean. University of Washington research showed a decade ago that rivers exhale huge amounts of carbon dioxide – though left open the question of how that was possible, since bark and stems were thought to be too tough for river bacteria to digest.
A study published this week in Nature Geoscience resolves the conundrum, proving that woody plant matter is almost completely digested by bacteria living in the Amazon River, and that this tough stuff plays a major part in fueling the river’s breath.
The finding has implications for global carbon models, and for the ecology of the Amazon and the world’s other rivers.
“People thought this was one of the components that just got dumped into the ocean,” said first author Nick Ward , a UW doctoral student in oceanography. “We’ve found that terrestrial carbon is respired and basically turned into carbon dioxide as it travels down the river.”
Tough lignin, which helps form the main part of woody tissue, is the second most common component of terrestrial plants. Scientists believed that much of it got buried on the seafloor to stay there for centuries or millennia. The new paper shows river bacteria break it down within two weeks, and that just 5 percent of the Amazon rainforest’s carbon ever reaches the ocean.
“Rivers were once thought of as passive pipes,” said co-author Jeffrey Richey , a UW professor of oceanography. “This shows they’re more like metabolic hotspots.”

Nick Ward collects samples of Amazon River water.
When previous research showed how much carbon dioxide was outgassing from rivers, scientists knew it didn’t add up. They speculated there might be some unknown, short-lived carbon source that freshwater bacteria could turn into carbon dioxide.
“The fact that lignin is proving to be this metabolically active is a big surprise,” Richey said. “It’s a mechanism for the rivers’ role in the global carbon cycle – it’s the food for the river breath.”
The Amazon alone discharges about one-fifth of the world’s freshwater and plays a large role in global processes, but it also serves as a test bed for natural river ecosystems.
Richey and his collaborators have studied the Amazon River for more than three decades. Earlier research took place more than 500 miles upstream. This time the U.S. and Brazilian team sought to understand the connection between the river and ocean, which meant working at the mouth of the world’s largest river – a treacherous study site.
NASA
The mouth of the Amazon River has three main channels, with an island the size of Switzerland in the middle.
“There’s a reason that no one’s really studied in this area,” Ward said. “Pulling it off has been quite a challenge. It’s a humongous, sloppy piece of water.”
The team used flat-bottomed boats to traverse the three river mouths, each so wide that you cannot see land, in water so rich with sediment that it looks like chocolate milk. Tides raise the ocean by 30 feet, reversing the flow of freshwater at the river mouth, and winds blow at up to 35 mph.
Under these conditions, Ward collected river water samples in all four seasons. He compared the original samples with ones left to sit for up to a week at river temperatures. Back at the UW, he used newly developed techniques to scan the samples for some 100 compounds, covering 95 percent of all plant-based lignin. Previous techniques could identify only 1 percent of the plant-based carbon in the water.
Based on the results, the authors estimate that about 40 percent of the Amazon’s lignin breaks down in soils, 55 percent breaks down in the river system, and 5 percent reaches the ocean, where it may break down or sink to the ocean floor.
“People had just assumed, ‘Well, it’s not energetically feasible for an organism to break lignin apart, so why would they?’” Ward said. “We’re thinking that as rain falls over the land it’s taking with it these lignin compounds, but it’s also taking with it the bacterial community that’s really good at eating the lignin.”
The research was supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , the National Science Foundation and the Research Council for the State of São Paulo . Co-authors are Richard Keil at the UW; Patricia Medeiros and Patricia Yager at the University of Georgia; Daimio Brito and Alan Cunha at the Federal University of Amap in Brazil; Thorsten Dittmar at Carl von Ossietzky University in Germany; and Alex Krusche at University of São Paulo in Brazil.

Making quantum encryption practical
An MIT team that proposed a new, more-practical scheme for using quantum physics to secure data transmission has now demonstrated it experimentally.

One of the many promising applications of quantum mechanics in the information sciences is quantum key distribution (QKD), in which the counterintuitive behavior of quantum particles guarantees that no one can eavesdrop on a private exchange of data without detection.
As its name implies, QKD is intended for the distribution of cryptographic keys that can be used for ordinary, nonquantum cryptography. That’s because it requires the transmission of a huge number of bits for each one that’s successfully received. That kind of inefficiency is tolerable for key distribution, but not for general-purpose communication.
Also, because QKD depends on the properties of individual light particles — photons — it’s very vulnerable to signal loss, which is inevitable over large enough distances. Although QKD systems have been built — some commercially — they generally work across distances of only 100 miles or so.
In a series of recent papers, researchers in the Optical and Quantum Communications Group at MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics described a new quantum communication protocol that could solve both of these problems. It’s much more resilient to signal loss than QKD, and it sends only one bit for every one received.
In the latest issue of Physical Review Letters, they describe the first experimental implementation of their system, which bore out all their theoretical predictions.
At present, the protocol does have one major caveat: It’s secure only against so-called passive eavesdroppers, who simply siphon light from an optical transmission, and not against active eavesdroppers, who maliciously inject their own light into a communication channel. Security against passive eavesdropping is probably adequate for some optical communication systems, but if the researchers can figure out how to thwart active eavesdroppers, too, their protocol could be used to secure optical data transmission over long distances.
Cascading correlations
Like all quantum information schemes, the new protocol exploits the central mystery of quantum physics: the ability of tiny particles of matter to inhabit mutually exclusive states at the same time. Electrons, for instance, have a property called spin, which describes how they act in a magnetic field. Spin can be either up or down, but it can also be in a strange quantum state known as superposition, in which it’s up and down simultaneously.
According to Jeffrey Shapiro, the Julius A. Stratton Professor of Electrical Engineering and one of the co-directors of the Optical and Quantum Communications Group, quantum particles are capable of a greater degree of correlation than objects described by classical physics. A coin, for instance, can be either face-up or face-down. If you glue a second coin to it, face-to-face, the states of the two coins are correlated: If one is up, the other is down, and vice versa.
In the same way, if two electrons are orbiting the nucleus of an atom at the same distance, their spins are correlated: If one is up, the other must be down. But there’s a third possibility: If one is up and down at the same time, so is the other.
This kind of mutual dependency, even in particles separated by great distances, is known as entanglement. But entanglement is very fragile: It begins to break down as soon as particles start interacting with their immediate environments. The key to the new protocol, Shapiro explains, is that even if the entanglement between two light beams breaks down, and their degree of correlation falls back within classical limits, it can still remain much higher than it would be if the beams had a merely classical correlation to begin with.
Bring the noise
Following cryptographic convention, the RLE researchers describe their protocol in terms of a secure communication between Alice and Bob, with an eavesdropper, named Eve, trying to listen in. Alice creates two entangled light beams and sends one of them to Bob, keeping the other one circulating locally.
“In classical physics, there’s a maximum amount of correlation you can get between two events,” Shapiro says. In the new protocol, however, the entangled beams “have a correlation that exceeds — by orders of magnitude — the classical limit.”
As one of those beams travels toward Bob, interactions with the environment begin to break the entanglement, introducing degradations of signal quality that engineers call “noise.” Bob then adds information to the beam, amplifies it — which adds much more noise — and sends it back. Alice uses the beam she kept circulating locally to decode Bob’s transmission.
Eve, on the other hand, extracts some of the signal that Alice sends Bob and uses that to decode Bob’s transmission. Because Bob’s transmission is so noisy, its correlation with Eve’s sample signal is much lower than it is with the signal Alice kept.
“My experiment can show for the communication between Alice and Bob, if Bob sends one megabit of information, about one bit gets flipped,” says Zheshen Zhang, a postdoc at RLE and first author on the new paper. “For the eavesdropper, about half of the bits get flipped.”
“The first distinction between this and what other people have done in the past is that Jeff’s protocol is a direct secure-communication protocol,” says Saikat Guha, a senior scientist at Raytheon subsidiary BBN Technologies who works on quantum optical communications and imaging. “This is not a key distribution protocol.”
As for whether the system will work over long distances, “we don’t have all the answers yet, but this does seem to have better promise than some of the standard QKD protocols,” Guha says. “In the standard QKD protocols, one big requirement is to have quantum repeaters, which are devices that are not yet available. People are working on it, but there aren’t any quantum repeaters. So you can’t do standard QKD over standard fiber for more than a couple hundred kilometers at the most.”
Guha observes that the RLE researchers’ protocol isn’t secure against active eavesdropping, but says, “I think it’s very promising that it will be adapted to active eavesdropping. It’s just that the analysis hasn’t been done.”
“We’re working on the theory for active eavesdropping,” Shapiro adds.

A new study led by Oxford University concludes that the latest observations of the climate system's response to rising greenhouse gas levels are consistent with conventional estimates of the long-term 'climate sensitivity', despite a ''warming pause'' over the past decade. However, the most extreme rates of warming simulated by the current generation of climate models over 50- to 100-year timescales are looking less likely, according to the paper published online by Nature Geoscience.
Their findings, resulting from a broad international collaboration of scientists, are significant because they use the most up-to-date information on temperatures, energy flows and energy accumulation in the climate system available to the next Scientific Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, due to be finalised in September.
Dr Alexander Otto, from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said: 'Recent observations suggest the expected rate of warming in response to rising greenhouse gas levels, or 'Transient Climate Response,' is likely to lie within the range of current climate models, but not at the high end of this range.
'The eventual long-term warming after stabilization remains rather uncertain, but for most policy decisions, the transient response over the next 50-100 years is what matters.'
Professor Reto Knutti of ETH Zurich said: 'Clearly, new data helping to rule out more extreme scenarios for near-term rates of warming is welcome news, but even if the response is at the low end of the current range of uncertainty, we are still looking at warming well over the two degree goal that countries have agreed upon if current emission trends continue.'
Professor Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg said: 'It is important not to over-interpret a single decade, given what we know, and don't know, about natural climate variability. Over the past decade, the world as a whole has continued to warm, but the warming is mostly in the subsurface oceans rather than at the surface.'
Professor Piers Forster of the University of Leeds said: 'We know much more than we did only a few years ago how different factors, like global aerosol emissions, affect the global energy budget, and this new study draws out the implications.'

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22596270|Bahrain digs unveil one of oldest civilisations
By Sylvia Smith BBC News, Manama, Bahrain
The Saar site was effectively a modern city with restaurants and shops, say archaeologists
Excavations at an archaeological site in Bahrain are shedding light on one of the oldest trading civilisations.
Despite its antiquity, comparatively little is known about the advanced culture represented at Saar.
The site in Bahrain, thought to be the location of the enigmatic Dilmun civilisation, was recently discussed at a conference in Manama, the Gulf nation's capital, organised by the UN's educational, scientific and cultural body (Unesco).
The belief system here has a lot in common with those of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt”
End Quote Abdullah Hassan Yehia Keeper, Bahrain Fort
The meeting was devoted to wide-ranging debate on heritage tourism; Bahrain is a Unesco regional headquarters and one of its key attractions is an abundance of ancient sites.
At Saar (named after the closest modern village), with the scorching sun rising ever higher in the sky, a Bahraini archaeologist patiently explained to a group of workers how to re-point a low wall in a state of near collapse.
This meticulous maintenance of the archaeological settlement marks a turning point in the way Bahraini specialists are dealing with the vast store of historical remains on the island.
According to Salman al-Mahari, the Bahraini archaeologist in charge, the Saar settlement divides into two: a residential zone and, at a small distance, the cemetery where the inhabitants buried their dead.
Archaeologists have uncovered a cemetery some distance from Saar's residential zone
"This site has provided a lot of information about daily life," he explains. "This has enabled us to compare finds made here with objects unearthed at other locations on the island. It is evident that this city and graveyard date back to the early Dilmun period."
Dilmun, one of most important ancient civilisations of the region and said to date to the third millennium BC, was a hub on a major trading route between Mesopotamia - the world's oldest civilisation - and the Indus Valley in South Asia.
It is also believed that Dilmun had commercial ties with ancient sites at Elam in Oman, Alba in Syria and Haittan in Turkey.
As Salman al-Mahari confirms, the team is now preserving what has been found to ensure that the historical findings are made accessible.
"For 4,000 years this site was underground so it was sheltered," he says. "Now after excavation, it is exposed to the elements. We have no immediate plans to carry out further excavations. We want to protect the site and to interpret what we have unearthed for visitors."
The Saar site is far from being the most significant relic of the Dilmun era. On the northern tip of the island, archaeological expeditions have uncovered seven successive levels of settlements at the Qal'at al Bahrain (the fort of Bahrain). Under the oldest and most extensive fort, three consecutive Dilmun cities as well as a Greek city dating back to 200 BC have been unearthed.
The site is impressive: the outer walls enclose an area of several hundred square metres. At its centre lie massive carved stones marking the entrance and walls of a chamber containing an altar once flanked by copper-faced pillars.
The Dilmun civilisation was a trading link between the Middle East and South Asia
Next to it is another structure where the presence of blackened animal bones and charred earth suggest a chamber for sacrifices to the gods.
On the other side of the central altar, a flight of carved steps leads down to a pool, a deep, stone-walled well built over one of the numerous underground springs where one of three principal Sumerian deities - Enki, the water-dwelling god of wisdom - supposedly lived.
The abundance of sweet water flowing from springs which still supply the island with much of its drinking water was one of the cornerstones of Dilmun. The island was an oasis of fertility in ancient times in a mainly desolate region. This could have given rise to a legend that Bahrain may even have been the biblical Garden of Eden.
But as Abdullah Hassan Yehia, the keeper of the Qal'at al Bahrain, explains, the fertile nature of the island encouraged more than just agriculture (Dilmun was famed for its vegetable production). There is strong evidence of religious practices and beliefs that can be compared with those in other advanced societies of the time.
"The belief system here has a lot in common with those of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt," he says. "Belief in the after-life is shown by burying the dead with possessions such as tools, food, drinking vessels and gold. We've even found weapons."
Abdullah Hassan Yehia also explains that the Dilmun merchants had a monopoly of trade in copper, a precious commodity which was shipped from the mines of Oman to the cities of Mesopotamia. But he debunks the theory that Bahrain may have been used by prehistoric inhabitants of the Arabian mainland as a cemetery.
The fort overlies three consecutive Dilmun cities
The island has approximately 170,000 burial mounds covering an area of 30 square kilometres or 5% of the main island area.
The majority of the burial grounds date back to the second and third centuries BC but some are as recent as 2,000 years old. The oldest and largest burial mounds, referred to as the "Royal Tombs", are found at Aali and measure up to 15m in height and 45m in diameter.
Archaeologist Salman Al-Mahari agrees: "There were a number of large population centres on the island. We have calculated that there would have been a significant number of deaths of both adults and children who would have been buried here," he says.
This sort of debate is exactly what Khalifa Ahmed Al Khalifa, assistant director of programmes at the Arab regional Centre for World Heritage is keen to encourage.
Khalifa Ahmed al-Khalifa from the Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage explains why it is time to make the "extraordinary artefacts" available to the public
"There has been a lot of academic work carried out over the past decades," he recaps. "The idea is to simplify and interpret all this academic information so that local people and international visitors can grasp the importance of our heritage."
Using Saar as an example, he continues. "It includes houses, restaurants, commercial outlets, a cemetery and a place of worship. These are all part of a modern city."
"One of the characteristics of Saar are its honeycomb-shaped burial complexes. This is the sort of thing that people find fascinating," he adds. "As long as it is presented in an easily digestible way."
While academic research continues into life 4,000 years ago in Dilmun, with an emphasis on trade, diet, gods, pottery and other industries as well as local burial customs, there is now a focus on making everything interesting to the layperson.
"It's quite a challenge that we're facing," says Khalifa Ahmed al-Khalif. "But with the help of new technology we'll be able to place Bahrain on the [ancient] global map."

Internet measurement techniques need a complete overhaul. New ways have emerged, potentially displacing older panel-based technologies. This will make it hard for incumbent players to stay in the game.
The web user is the most watched consumer ever. For tracking purposes, every large site drops literally dozens of cookies in the visitor’s browser. In the most comprehensive investigation on the matter, The Wall Street Journal found that each of the 50 largest web sites in the United Sates, weighing 40% of the US page views, installed an average of 64 files on a user device. (See the WSJ’s What They Know series and a Monday Note about tracking issues .) As for server logs, they record every page sent to the user and they tell with great accuracy which parts of a page collect most of the reader’s attention.
But when it comes to measuring a digital viewer’s commercial value, sites rely on old-fashioned panels, that is limited user population samples. Why?
Panels are inherited. They go back to the old days of broadcast radio when, in order to better sell advertising, dominant networks wanted to know which station listeners tuned in to during the day. In the late thirties, Nielsen Company made a clever decision: they installed a monitoring box in 1000 American homes. Twenty years later, Nielsen did the same, on a much larger scale, with broadcast television. The advertising world was happy to be fed with plenty of data — mostly unchallenged as Nielsen dominated the field. (For a detailed history, you can read Rating the Audience , written by two Australian media academics). As Nielsen expanded to other media (music, film, books and all sorts of polls), moving to the internet measurement sounded like a logical step. As of today, Nielsen only faces smaller competitors such as ComScore and others.
I have yet to meet a publisher who is happy with this situation. Fearing retribution, very few people talk openly about it (twisting the dials is so easy, you know…), but hey all complain about inaccurate, unreliable data. In addition, the panel system is vulnerable to cheating on a massive scale. Smarty pants outfits sell a vast array of measurement boosters, from fake users that will come in just once a month to be counted as “unique” (they are indeed), to more sophisticated tactics such as undetectable “pop under” sites that will rely on encrypted URLs to deceive the vigilance of panel operators. In France for instance, 20% to 30% of some audiences can be bogus — or largely inflated. To its credit, Mediametrie — the French Nielsen affiliate that produces the most watched measurements — is expending vast resources to counter the cheating, and to make the whole model more reliable. It works, but progress is slow. In August 2012, Mediametrie Net Ratings (MNR), launched a Hybrid Measure taking into account site centric analytics (server logs) to rectify panel numbers, but those corrections are still erratic. And it takes more than a month to get the data, which is not acceptable for the real-time-obsessed internet.
Publishers monitor the pulse of their digital properties on a permanent basis. In most newsrooms, Chartbeat (also imperfect, sometimes) displays the performance of every piece of content, and home pages get adjusted accordingly. More broadly, site-centric measures detail all possible metrics: page views, time spent, hourly peaks, engagement levels. This is based on server logs tracking dedicated tags inserted in each served page. But the site-centric measure is also flawed: If you use, say, four different devices — a smartphone, a PC at home, another at work, and a tablet — you will be incorrectly counted as four different users. And if you use several browsers you could be counted even more times. This inherent site-centric flaw is the best argument for panel vendors.
But, in the era of Big Data and user profiling, panels no longer have the upper hand.
The developing field of statistical pairing technology shows great promise. It is now possible to pinpoint a single user browsing the web with different devices in a very reliable manner. Say you use the four devices mentioned earlier: a tablet in the morning and the evening; a smartphone for occasional updates on the move, and two PCs (a desktop at the office and a laptop elsewhere). Now, each time you visit a new site, an audience analytics company drops a cookie that will record every move on every site, from each of your devices. Chances are your browsing patterns will be stable (basically your favorite media diet, plus or minus some services that are better fitted for a mobile device.) Not only your browsing profile is determined from your navigation on a given site, but it is also quite easy to know which sites you have been to before the one that is currently monitored, adding further precision to the measurement.
Over time, your digital fingerprint will become more and more precise. Until then, the set of four cookies is independent from each other. But the analytics firm compiles all the patterns in single place. By data-mining them, analysts will determine the probability that a cookie dropped in a mobile application, a desktop browser or a mobile web site belongs to the same individual. That’s how multiple pairing works. (To get more details on the technical and mathematical side of it, you can read this paper by the founder of Drawbridge Inc.) I recently discussed these techniques with several engineers both in France and in the United Sates. All were quite confident that such fingerprinting is doable and that it could be the best way to accurately measure internet usage across different platforms.
Obviously, Google is best positioned to perform this task on a large scale. First, its Google Analytics tool is deployed over 100 millions web sites. And the Google Ad Planner, even in its public version, already offers a precise view of the performance of many sites in the world. In addition, as one of the engineers pointed out, Google is already performing such pairing simply to avoid showing the same ad twice to a someone using several devices. Google is also most likely doing such ranking in order to feed the obscure “quality index” algorithmically assigned to each site. It even does such pairing on a nominative basis by using its half billion Gmail accounts (425 million in June 2012) and connecting its Chrome users. As for giving up another piece of internet knowledge to Google, it doesn’t sounds like a big deal to me. The search giant knows already much more about sites than most publishers do about their own properties. The only thing that could prevent Google from entering the market of public web rankings would be the prospect of another privacy outcry. But I don’t see why it won’t jump on it — eventually. When this happens, Nielsen will be in big trouble.

http://realestalker.blogspot.com/2013/05/rob-dyrdek-sells-at-loss-to-blake.html|Rob Dyrdek Sells at a loss to Blake Anderson
SELLER: Rob Dyrdek
PRICE: $1,175,000
SIZE: 2,792 square feet, 3 bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms
YOUR MAMAS NOTES: As of June 2012 professional skateboarder turned hard-charging entrepreneur and reality television host Rob Dyrdek (Rob and Big, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy, and the currently in airing Ridiculousness) owned not just one but three million dollar-plus houses in L.A.'s fabled Hollywood Hills: one in the Mount Olympus community, another in the Hollywood Knolls nabe and a third in a little known 'hood called Laurel Hills.
Mister Dyrdek's most recent addition to his property portfolio came in June 2012 when he shelled out $2.5 million for a fully renovated two story contemporary in the sleepy Laurel Hills neighborhood at the top of Laurel Canyon. Listing details from the time of his purchase show the residence of just over 3,700 square feet has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a long, just about unimpeded view that sweeps across a wide swathe of the San Fernando Valley.
Last November (2012) Mister Dyrdek sold a boxy, concrete and glass contemporary in the Mount Olympus neighborhood above Laurel Canyon for $2,125,000, a figure that represents a bank account brutalizing $334,000 loss from the $2,459,000 he paid for the place back in May 2008.*
Fortunately for Mister Dyrdek, he recently and finally, after almost five years on and off the market at a variety of prices, unloaded a mid-sixties modern in the somewhat geographically discrete Hollywood Knolls neighborhood. No, puppies, Your Mama did not make a liquor-fueled typo. The house really was on and off the market for nearly five years. Unfortunately, like with Mount Olympus house on which he lost a bundle, Mister Dyrdek sold his Hollywood Knolls house at a significant loss. Property records show he paid $1,400,000 for the hillside house in June 2005 and online evidence suggests he first listed it in June 2008 at $1.75 million. By October of 2012 the asking price had fallen to $1,199,000 and property records reveal Mister Dyrdek managed to shed his real estate albatross a few weeks ago, in mid-March 2013, for $1,175,000.
A few clicks and clacks on the well-worn beads of Your Mama's bejeweled abacus shows that Mister Dyrdek has tallied up a throat constricting real estate loss of $559,000 in the last year, not counting other also significant expenses such as (but not necessarily limited to) carrying costs, improvements and real estate fees. Presumably Mister Dyrdek's money managers and accountants know how to turn all those losses into a tax benefit. Isn't that how it's done?
The Hollywood Knolls house was purchased, according to property records, through a vaguely named trust that Your Mama's celebrity real estate Deep Throat Lucy Spillerguts tells us is controlled by the thickly mustachioed and crazily kinky-haired comedian and actor Blake Anderson.
Mister Anderson may not be a big household name in the vein of au courant comedians like, say, Louis C.K., but he's been a solidly upwardly mobile minor player in the comedy scene for the last several years. He studied with the legendary improv comedy groups The Groundlings and the Upright Citizens Brigade before he co-founded his own sketch comedy group, Mail Order Comedy , with longtime b.f.f.s and fellow comedic up and comers  Adam DeVine , Anders Holm , and Kyle Newacheck .
Over the last few years the recently secretly married Mister Anderson has popped up on a couple of primetime sitcoms programs (Community, Entourage) and a handful of short form t.v. series (Crossbows & Mustaches, 5th Year) but unarguably his big Showbiz break came in 2010 when he and his Mail Order Comedy cohorts were tapped to write, produce and co-star in Workaholics, a raunchy and low brow yet smartly conceived scripted series, now in its third season with two more seasons already ordered by the network. The show centers on three sophomoric post-college man-children—and their dopey drug dealer—who live together and share a single cubicle at a soul-crushing telemarketing company. It's kind of Girls for guys, dudes and brahs who think sexting is sexy and farting is funny. Just FYI, kids: underneath all that frizzy hair and slacker-hipster attire there lurks the slender, taut and hairless body of a twink but that's really neither here nor there, is it? Anyways...
Property records show the glutially unfriendly multi-level mid-century modern post and beam residence was built high on the hillside of a steep but generous .45 acre lot in 1967 and listing details Your Mama squirreled out of the interweb show there are three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms in 2,792 square feet.
The street-level two car garage is an excellent feature in the tightly packed Hills of Hollywood but it only takes eyeballs to see the house looms spectacularly high over the street. This is not, children, a house for anyone with underdeveloped haunches or a bad ticker. By Your Mama's observation and estimation it's at least two full flights from the street to the front door that opens (awkwardly) directly into a combination foyer/sitting room with raised fireplace and mottled copper and ocher slate tile flooring.
It's another full flight up to a proper living room with yellow blond wood floors under foot and a wonderfully decadent 15-foot ceiling overhead. Your Mama appreciates the architectural meatiness of the massive raised hearth fireplace with its double smoke stake flue and we swoon for the full wall of glass panels and sliding glass doors that connects to a small terrace with big canyon and sky views. Knowing this neighborhood as we do, Your Mama thinks this house might have a terrific view of the 101 Freeway as it bends its way through the Cahuenga Pass between Hollywood and Studio City in the San Fernando Valley.
Behind the fireplace another half flight of stairs leads up to an open concept dining and kitchen space that overlooks the living room. As inconvenient as it might be to have the living room on a separate level from the dining room and kitchen, it's the three-plus flight hike from the street to the kitchen that really seems like, well, a literal and figurative pain in the patooty. We know for sure that our house gal Svetlana would demand a minimum of a 20% raise if we were to ask her to schlep our groceries, cleaning supplies and other kitchen and bathroom necessities up all them stairs on a regular basis.
The kitchen isn't huge but it is certainly reasonably well equipped with decent grade stainless steel appliances, speckled granite counter tops on cherry-finish cabinetry, and a center island snack bar with built-in microwave cubby. However, the kitchen also looks like a bit of an after thought that was shoved thoughtlessly up into corner. With all that head space Your Mama wonders why the kitchen designer didn't take the cabinets all the way to the ceiling or anchor the airy space more effectively with a larger center island but, alas.
The master suite occupies a private end of the upper level and claims a full wall of glass sliders that open to a private terrace in the tree tops that's perfect for a post coital cigarette and/or a weekend wake and bake with a loved one. The average sized attached master bathroom is almost entirely decked in white with a contrasting gray slate tile floors. Along one wall there's a double sink vanity that looks to Your Mama like it might be from Ikea and on the opposite wall there's a glassed in white tile shower stall. Two more bedrooms with a shared hall bathroom and laundry facilities located on a separate floor ensure seclusion for guests and secretive teenagers.
The dining area opens through sliders to a slender pergola shaded dining terrace that makes a long run between the back of the house and the plunge-sized swimming pool. The swimming pool may be in-ground but the spa shown in listing photos is one of those above ground things that we imagine had to be craned in since—as we've repeatedly mentioned—it's a long, long, long haul from the street. The backyard is remarkably roomy and flat for a house in the hills and besides the pool and spa includes a small deck for sunbathing, a wee patch of lawn and a towering retaining wall that holds back the steep and densely foliaged up slope behind the house.
We don't know if Mister Anderson currently owns (or previously owned) any other residential property in Los Angeles or in the Bay Area where he was born and bred but we do know that in 2011 the moe-ron fractured his damn spine when he jumped off the roof of his house and landed on a beer pong table. This ass-hat move, children, was not only  captured on video  but put up on the internets for the world to gawk at. Now that, children, is classy with a capital K.
*Interestingly the non-celebrity buyer immediately caught a severe case of The Real Estate Fickle and flipped the property back on the market two months later with the familiar asking price of $2.125 million. A couple months later the asking price was raised to $2,295,000. A marketing maneuver like that might seem counterintuitive to some but was absolutely effective because the property was put into escrow just two weeks later.

"The Good Wife"
<strong>"The Good Wife," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: A former ratings champ, "The Good Wife" has slipped to series low ratings on Sunday nights.

"Hawaii Five-0"
<strong>"Hawaii Five-0," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: In March, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/27/the-good-wife-renewed-season-5_n_2965829.html" target="_hplink">CBS announced "Hawaii Five-0" received an early renewal along with several of its other popular programs</a>.

"NCIS: LA"
<strong>"NCIS: LA," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: Viewers love their "NCIS," in any form. The ratings have been strong and the network is producing a backdoor spinoff pilot for this spinoff show. A full night of "NCIS" could be in CBS's future.
"Partners"
<strong>"Partners," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Canceled <strong>Why</strong>: Low ratings and unfavorable reviews led to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/partners-canceled-cbs_n_2145832.html">early demise</a> of this CBS comedy.
"Person of Interest"
<strong>"Person of Interest," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: The series has developed a nice-sized audience, bigger than its first season.
"Rules of Engagement"
<strong>"Rules of Engagement," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Canceled <strong>Why</strong>: This comedy has been on the bubble since it premiered ... yet it made it to Season 7. It's finally time to say goodbye.
"Survivor"
<strong>"Survivor," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: A strong player for the last 13 years, "Survivor" will be back. But due to its <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/survivor-ratings-lowest-premiere-ever_n_2687591.html">most recent premiere ratings</a>, we might not see it during the fall season, though a midseason or summer return -- with some new gimmick -- is definitely in the cards for the reality series.
"Two and a Half Men"
<strong>"Two and a Half Men," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: CBS always wanted another season of this bawdy hit, it was just a matter of getting its stars to sign back on. Though Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher will be back for a Season 11, the "half" man Angus T. Jones remains up in the air.
"Undercover Boss"
<strong>"Undercover Boss," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Renewed <strong>Why</strong>: The show is enjoying life in syndication and its Season 4 numbers are better than most of its third season.
"Unforgettable"
<strong>"Unforgettable," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Uncanceled <strong>Why</strong>: CBS canceled the Poppy Montgomery drama last season ... and then revived it! Season 2 premieres Sunday, July 28.
"Vegas"
<strong>"Vegas," CBS</strong> <strong>Status</strong>: Canceled <strong>Why</strong>: Despite star power, the series wasn't a breakout hit in the ratings. CBS previously canceled "Unforgettable" (then uncanceled it) last season when it was doing about the same as "Vegas."

The Drake will reopen its doors on June 22, when ABC’s 666 Park Avenue returns to finish up its freshman run.
The ill-fated spooker — which ABC pulled from the schedule after its Dec. 2, 2012 broadcast — will unspool its four remaining episodes on Saturdays at 9/8c, with the finale airing July 13.
RELATED | TVLine’s 2013 Renewal Scorecard: What’s Coming Back? What’s Getting Cancelled?
Since the series’ producers had opportunity to deliver closure for its fans, Rachael Taylor, for one, gives the final episode two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
“I love the ending,” the actress told TVLine last week at NBC’s Upfront event, where she was touting her new series Crisis. “Everything gets completely flipped on its head, and it was very fun for me to play. My character is very different in the last episode. I’m really looking forward to people seeing the end, because s—t gets crazy.”

http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/2013/05/will-smith-is-messing-around-with-kanye-and-other-obnoxiousness-from-the-smith-family-press-tour|Written by Vince Mancini / 05.21.13
Most of us expected Will Smith and his dumb wiener kid promoting their new M. Night Shyamalan movie to be about the most insufferable thing ever, and the Smith gang, as usual, doesn’t disappoint when it comes to milquetoast dildodry. First, dad Will dropped by Letterman last night, and made sure everyone knows he still enjoys rap.
Witness, for example, Smith’s big Late Show entrance last night, which the CBS Orchestra thoughtfully underscored with the strains of “Summertime.” Once he recognized they were playing his song, the movie star couldn’t resist rapping along. And after he noticed that his mic wasn’t capturing his rhymes, Smith also couldn’t resist stealing one of the band’s microphones and starting his verse over from the beginning. [ EW ]
Jesus, just give him his own variety show already, where he can sing, act, dance, and give wise parenting advice in between mugging for the camera and talking about how thankful he is. Meanwhile, at an After Earth press junket, Smith made sure to drop a juicy nugget about possibly working with Kanye:
“I been, uh, messing around with Kanye, we’ve been in the studio together a couple times. I might get the bug. I’m not gonna do it unless I’m truly inspired. But.. yeah, he’s been pushing me a little bit.”
Will Smith and Kanye in the same room, my God, you could power Cowboys Stadium for a month if you built a turbine to catch that much compressed blowhard air.
Ahh, but it wouldn’t be a Smith press tour without his dumb wiener kids being foisted upon us at every opportunity, and for that, Jaden was on Jimmy Fallon, where the 14-year-old talked told us all about his clothing line, his mixtape… you know, regular kid stuff.
FALLON: You have your own clothing line, it’s called Misfits.
JADEN: It started out just me and my friends making clothes, because we didn’t like any of the clothes out. The clothes out didn’t fit us. So we started making our own clothes, like the drop-crotch pants.
Oh sure, I remember when me and my friends used to get together and dream about creating the perfect designer pant. YOU GO, JADEN! Living the dream!
Meanwhile, Jaden didn’t skip an opportunity to rap either:
After a ranging Late Night conversation about skateboarding, the movie, and how Jimmy Fallon’s an old man (at least compared to his guest), the Fresh Prince’s heir apparent grabbed a mic and performed a song off his mixtape The Cool Cafe with the Roots. Sample lyrics: “I might be tripping but I’m living how I’m living/I’m 14, I’ll be forgiven/ So forget it bro, I’m moving in.” Guess swagger doesn’t skip a generation. [ EW ]
God, that’s just everything wrong with media coverage of the Smiths in a nutshell, isn’t it? Has Will Smith incepted everyone?
So, here’s the thing about “swagger”: it’s only impressive when it’s something you’ve developed yourself through your own hard work. When you’re born rich, that’s not called “swagger,” it’s called being an asshole. Since when is it cool to brag about your dad’s money? Not that I blame Jaden Smith for being an asshole. I know people think he’s incredibly punchable, but it’s not really his fault. 14-year-olds are assholes. I was an asshole when I was 14. That’s why you need adults around to tell you what you need to hear at that age, like “shut up,” and “hey, maybe you should stop talking for a while.”
What you don’t need are a bunch of trained seals hanging around flapping their flippers together and telling you how great you are for inventing baggy pants. Go read a goddamn book. And get off my lawn.

ESPN is laying off a portion of its staff today, a network spokesman confirms to us. How many? ESPN won't say. A tipster told us earlier today that it would be more than 400 staffers. A source at ESPN said that number is a little high, but it appears to be in the hundreds.
Here's the statement from ESPN:
We are implementing changes across the company to enhance our continued growth while smartly managing costs. While difficult, we are confident that it will make us more competitive, innovative and productive.
So where in the world did this come from? ESPN is monstrously profitable and we hadn't heard a word about this until this morning. Well, ESPN has been gobbling up live rights to events left and right, and those rights are really expensive. We've heard they needed to reduce costs as a result. Also: ESPN's parent company Disney is apparently asking all divisions to cut costs.
This is ESPN's first major staff reduction since 2009.
We heard the technology group is getting hit pretty hard: at least 40 layoffs are coming there. A source told us that some employees who get a pink slip today can continue working through the end of the week if they'd like. ESPN has 7,000 employees.
UPDATE, 11:54 a.m.: A laid-off ESPN employee writes us:
I was laid off from ESPN today after 9 and a half years. Completely out of the blue, no warning at all. I was told it was 10% across the board, which would be roughly 400. I was told the reason was they needed to make their profit margin and they chose to do that via layoff of staff.
UPDATE, 12:10 p.m.: More from the laid-off staffer:
btw.....we were told that the layoffs ARE tied to the profit margin that ESPN needs to meet and the fact they haven't met that number. Your comments about them buying all of these live rights and now needed to reduce overhead costs is dead on.
Additionally, this staffer got the following:
gets to keep key cards and access until Friday
will continue to get paid through the end of July
a severance package, which appears to be 2 weeks for every year worked
UPDATE, 12:20 p.m.: A reader writes that ESPN's "Denver Office in the Denver Tech Center was shut down yesterday. All 20 staff members were let go." A second source told us the same thing about the Denver office.
UPDATE, 12:25 p.m.: Those Guys Have All The Fun co-author Jim Miller hears that the number of layoffs is between 300 and 400.
UPDATE, 12:39 p.m.: By the way, Disney's stock hit an all-time high two weeks ago. God.
UPDATE, 12:48 p.m.: More from our source who was just laid off by ESPN:
The majority of the layoffs today and tomorrow are in Technology...something like 40 people, at least that's what I've heard. All three HR people assigned to Technology are handling layoffs today and tomorrow. No idea what is going on in the other departments. I was told ESPN was forced, by Disney, to do the layoffs due to profit margins. The end numbers / percentages, may not be exactly what they're telling us as we're being laid off. The last time there were layoffs, ESPN used it as an opportunity to get rid of older, higher paid workers, while continuing to fill jobs, including the same jobs of people who were laid off (Supervisors in Operations, for instance). I haven't quite figured out why they didn't try salary reductions, or at least offer salary reductions as an option / alternative to being laid off. It doesn't seem like they're quite the people caring company they'd have people believe they are.
UPDATE, 1:05 p.m.: Reminder: Last week, ESPN released a video of its huge new SportsCenter set. The building that's going to house that set is going to cost ESPN $125 million.
UPDATE, 1:24 p.m.: A still-employed ESPN source tells me that ESPNU's new late-night show UNITE will be canceled in July. The staff of the show found out today. The source tells me "that people on the show who have not been with ESPN for more than 10 months are being let go. 65% of the staff was hired nine months ago." We're not sure how many people this will impact but my source says more than a dozen will lose their jobs from this.
UPDATE, 2:01 p.m.: We heard from a UNITE staffer who said that the staff hasn't been told that the show is canceled, but they're expecting that.
UPDATE, 2:53 p.m.: More mail from the laid-off ESPN staffer. The soon-to-be ex-employee emphasizes what a shock this was:
This was just such a surprise. When they did the layoffs in 2009, there were rumors and rumblings, and people sort of prepared themselves and hoped for the best. With the build of DC2, and all the rest of the work going on, and the record profits. There was just absolutely no hint of potential layoffs. No one expects an employer to say, "hey, layoffs are imminent," but generally employees do get a feel for when a company is going to be in layoff mode, due to earnings, or watching business decisions which are made. Every indication at ESPN has been of a profitable company continuing to expand. The people who've been laid off are not the deadweight 10%, a lot of them are the older, higher paid people who are undoubtedly going to be replaced with lower wage, young, new hires. This was purely about a company making a LOT of money (rumored internally to be $500 million ever other month) wanting even more and getting it at the expense of a lot of people and their lives. If they truly cared about their employees, they could have gotten creative with options for wage reductions or early retirement options. They hacked 400+ people and will no doubt replace those 400+ people with younger, cheaper, less experienced people. Ultimately, it's up to the viewers to determine if it makes any difference to THEM how a company behaves towards its employees in real life, and not just the illusion that company presents to the outside world. It seemed a great place to work, but a truly great company wouldn't have done this today, in the way it was done.
UPDATE, 4:59 p.m.: An ESPN source tells us that all departments "are under review." As The Big Lead is reporting , layoffs today (and more tomorrow) are concentrated in sales and technology. Production layoffs "will occur once the review is done," says our source. "Some departments started their review before others so that all the layoffs didn't occur at the same time." So, the bad news is going to continue for at least another week.
UPDATE, 5:26 p.m.: ESPN has found a way to articulate to employees about why these layoffs are happening—and apparently will continue in the coming weeks:
They said choosing who gets laid off will partly have to do with performance but mostly based on what positions they can do without. They said this is all cause of the money ESPN invested in its future—SEC Network, new digital center, NFL rights, etc. They expect ESPN to be extremely profitable in the future but they have to cut costs now to make sure they have enough money over the next few years while so much money is tied up in investing in the future.

" Star Wars : Episode VII" is coming in 2015 and we can pretty much expect news (and speculation) about the movie to appear on a fairly regular basis from now until then. Currently we know that J.J. Abrams is directing a script from Michael Arndt and that Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are all due to appear.
Now, a report comes from Latino Review that the star of "The Tudors," Jonathan Rhys Meyers , is being added to the cast. They point out that the actor appeared previously in Abrams' "Mission: Impossible III" and consequently already has a relationship with the director.
 
What is certain at this point is that the Henry VIII actor is going to be appearing on the small screen once again come the fall. NBC announced at their upfront presentation last week that they would be airing " Dracula ," which features Rhys Meyers in the title role, at 10pm on Fridays this fall.  The actor also appears in the upcoming film "The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones."
 
We will, of course, bring you more information as it comes in.

Jim Gaffigan is outnumbered. The comedian and actor lives with his wife, Jeannie Noth Gaffigan, and five children — that's not a typo — in a two-bedroom apartment in lower Manhattan.
It's a neighborhood that quite proudly abounds with hipsters, swingers, adults-only shops, men in high heels, and people who mutter to themselves on the street. But nothing may attract more surprise in the neighborhood than a Midwestern couple and their five children.
Jim Gaffigan is a widely acclaimed and traveled comedian — or, as his son once put it, "a stand-up chameleon" — who may be best-known for his routines about American food, like the misery that comes with eating Hot Pockets.
He's now written a book, the title of which comes from one of his children: Dad Is Fat. And it's about the challenge, complexity and pleasure of raising a large family in a small apartment.
"I've had people say, 'What, do you own an oil company? I mean, why would you subject yourself to that?' And I always just tell them I'm creating my own nationality," he tells NPR's Scott Simon. "But it's absurd. Living in New York is difficult enough, and attempting to raise five kids that don't end up heroin addicts on the Bowery is pretty ambitious."
Interview Highlights
On ending up with five children in Manhattan
"I'm a comedian, which is the opposite of a lifestyle that equips you to be a parent. So I, you know, married Jeannie, and she loved children, and I loved her, and I was terrified of it. Ten years ago I couldn't get a date, and now my apartment's crawling with babies — I don't know what happened.
"In an urban setting, when you live in an apartment building, you hear everything. But if you could imagine living under five little kids, it's a crisis ... we're now on our third set of downstairs neighbors, but when our two preceding neighbors were moving, they asked us to hide the fact that we had children from prospective buyers, and the only polite thing to do, really, is to hide your existence so you can trick the next set of downstairs neighbors. But there's been moments where we've had to hide our children in a bedroom, and it feels like a scene from Sound of Music, you know."

On the comedic potential of having children
"Babies should be classified as an antidepressant. It's pretty hard to be in a bad mood around a 5-month-old baby. That's not to say that when they're screaming it's a delight, but — you see the creativity that is kind of inherent, that, you know, growing up kind of squashes a lot, and the point of view of a comedian is just to look at the world differently, and I think that children have that. There's something about being a parent that has, I think, made me a better comedian.
"[Getting five kids into bed] is like dealing with terrorists. You have to cajole them, and you have to negotiate ... it's really the opposite of a hostage situation — instead of trying to get people out of there, you're trying to keep them in there: I'll give you whatever you want! What do you want, a helicopter to Cuba? Anything, just stay in there and don't hurt anyone."
On planning family outings
"I'm not really sure how Moses did it. I'm sure he was like, I wanted to leave for the Promised Land two weeks ago, and I can't get everyone to put their sandals on. So if you're taking your kids even someplace where they would want to go, you could say, 'Let's get ice cream,' and they still will just sit there, as if they were unsure what ice cream is. You have to dress them, and then there's always a shoe that's missing, and then when you're about to leave, of course that's when you have to change a diaper. And if it's during the winter, you might as well just not do it, because the gloves and mittens — you know, it'll be spring anyway."
On being the youngest of six
"[It] really only prepares you to be parented by really exhausted parents. It doesn't necessarily prepare you to be a parent of any sort. But, you know, my parents' generation, there was a different approach, I think specifically for fatherhood. They brought home the bacon, which did not mean actually buying the bacon or bringing it home, or even cooking the bacon — they just ate the bacon ... my father did nothing, and he didn't feel guilty at all. And I right now, I have a winter sling for a baby and a summer sling, and I still feel guilty."
On whether he'll ever move to the suburbs
"I understand the value of a yard. I understand the value of a kid just coming home covered in dirt because he was playing in mud. But that can also be accomplished — and there's a lot of values of living in a city environment. The people that I meet that grew up in a city, whether it's New York or Boston, I like them. They're well-adjusted. They're not freaked out by two men holding hands. They're not freaked out by socio- or economic or cultural differences, and that's, I think, an important gift to give children."

Does Any Girl Need a Princess for Inspiration?
Disney (via Pixar) made a film called Brave.  I didn't see it but the trailer made the heroine look feisty and well, pretty normal (for Disney).  But no, Disney decided, in putting out the doll, to change that look.  Thinner, more skin, even her face looks different.  There's been a big outcry.
Here's a Tumblr piece from artist Matthew Bogarts that includes the two images, side-by-side.  His commentary is very good.
Along comes David Trumble , an artist/illustrator, came up with his own list of Disney "princesses" called World of Women including:
Princess Jane Goodall "Jungle Princess"
Princess Gloria Steinem "Trailblazer Princess"
Many of them wear glasses (gasp!) and have gray hair.  And, of course, it is satire which makes it work even better.
The blog , Pigtail Pals and Ballcap Buddies, dedicated to children having a childhood, had a great thread called "Why Sexing Things Up for Kids is Stupid."
 
Questions  you should be asking yourself (and your kids!) while taking this in:  Would we ever see a man posed this way? Do any women you know in real  life stand this way? Why is this the version of femininity that is  taught by the mainstream to our kids? The author, Melissa, (not me) says:  Does Batman help?
Also, you should take 18 minutes to listen to David’s Tedx talk. Listen with your tween/teen if you’ve got one.
But we are SO used to seeing women look like this, both in illustrated form for children and video games and in advertising. Do we even see it anymore?
She says (and rightly so):
Stop with the sexy for the kids. I mean really. It isn’t necessary . It isn’t healthy for them . And it isn’t needed to turn a profit. Do better.
Yes, really.  Parents have always taken their kids to movies and bought toys.  Why does making them sexy matter to sales?
I'm also with her about "everything in its own time."   Kids grow up incredibly fast - why can't they have a childhood?

Melissa McCarthy and Billy Gardell on "Mike & Molly."
CBS is pulling the tornado-themed "Mike & Molly"season finale off the air.
“Due to the tragic events this afternoon in Oklahoma, we are pre-empting tonight’s season finale of 'Mike & Molly,' which has a related storyline," CBS said in a statement.
Photos from THR: 'The Big Bang Theory's' Nerdiest Guest Stars
Originally scheduled for 9:30 p.m. Monday, the third-season closer featured a tornado hitting Chicago. Here's the official description for the finale: "Mike and Carl get stuck working at the Renaissance Faire after their boss, Patrick, gets dumped by Mike's mother. later, as a tornado descends on Chicago, Mike and Molly each confess important news to each other."
Instead, a "Mike & Molly" repeat will air in its place. The season finale will be broadcast "at an appropriate date."
A two-mile-wide tornado hit suburbs of Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon, prompted by a severe storm system that hit the area Sunday.
CBS renewed "Mike & Molly" for a fourth season, which will receive a midseason premiere.

Ray Manzarek, keyboardist and founding member of The Doors, is dead at age 74.
Ray Manzarek, most known as a founding member of the '60s rock band The Doors, is dead. According to a message posted on the band's Facebook page , Manzarek died of bile duct cancer while in Rosenheim, Germany, on May 20. He was 74. Wife Dorothy Manzarek and brothers Rick and James were by his side.
An excerpt from the Facebook announcement is below:
"Manzarek is best known for his work with The Doors who formed in 1965 when Manzarek had a chance encounter on Venice Beach with poet Jim Morrison. The Doors went on to become one of the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, selling more than 100-million albums worldwide … After Morrison's death in 1971, Manzarek went on to become a best-selling author, and a Grammy-nominated recording artist in his own right. In 2002, he revitalized his touring career with Doors' guitarist and long-time collaborator, Robby Krieger."
Doors guitarist Robby Krieger also confirmed the news in the Facebook message, releasing this statement: "I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek. I'm just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life and I will always miss him."
The Chicago-born Manzarek met Morrison while studying film at UCLA. The two went on to create one of the most iconic bands of the '60s, described by Rolling Stone as possessing "eerie, powerful, almost shamanistic invocations." The band's name comes from the drug-trip book by Aldous Huxley, "The Doors of Perception."
After Morrison's death at age 27 in 1971, Manzarek released several more albums, including a collaboration with composer Philip Glass and two solo albums.

Justin Bieber was booed at the Billboard Music Awards, despite winning two awards and performing twice.
The "Beauty and the Beat" singer was accepting the Milestone Award when the crowd seemed to erupt in boos. Looking a bit confused, Bieber went on to assert that he thinks only the "craft" and his music should be considered, arguing that "none of the other bull" mattered. While it's unclear what Bieber was referencing, he has had a number of bad public relations moments as of late, having lost his temper with the paparazzi in London and being caught smoking marijuana.
"This is not a gimmick," Bieber said. "I’m an artist and I should be taken seriously.”
Bieber beat out a number of other artists , including Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift for the award. The Milestone Award was actually Bieber’s second trophy of the night. He also took home “Top Male Artist.”
It's unfortunately not the first time Bieber has been booed. He's previously encountered a similar reaction at a Canadian Football Game , a New York Knicks basketball game and at one of his own concerts , where he arrived hours late.
Other wild moments from the evening included Miguel coming up short on a jump move and landing on an audience member's neck , Nicki Minaj giving Lil Wayne a lapdance and Prince closing out the show with a killer performance.

By Agence France-Presse
Tweet
The pants worn by actor Mark Hamill in the first Oscar-winning “Star Wars” film are being sold at auction and could go for up to $100,000, auctioneers announced Monday.
The young Jedi Knight wore the sand-colored regular Levi’s pants throughout the 1977 movie, which launched the world-beating franchise by director George Lucas.
The pants will be put up for auction on Tuesday, with an estimated sale price of $70,000-$100,000.
“‘Star Wars’ is one of those rare cinematic experiences that most people remember their whole lives,” said Nate D. Sanders, whose company is auctioning the pants in Los Angeles.
“It’s hard to believe now, but ‘Star Wars’ in 1977 was not a ‘go’ from the start. Several studios passed on making it. But now, we look back on it, over 35 years later, and it’s the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time.”
The original movie, which launched the career of a young Harrison Ford, was soon followed by the equally popular “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980) and “Return of the Jedi” (1983).
In the late 1990s, Lucas drew mixed reviews when he resurrected the blockbuster series with a prequel trilogy: “The Phantom Menace” (1999), “The Attack of the Clones” (2002) and “The Revenge of the Sith” (2005).
Walt Disney Co announced plans to revive the series in October, when it bought Lucasfilm for $4 billion. Sci-fi and action filmmaker J.J. Abrams will direct “Episode VII,” scheduled for release in 2015.

Are the men of Mad Men in the midst of their Vietnam?
Photo by Jordin Althaus/AMC
Spoilers ahead
Is the Chevy account Mad Men’s Vietnam?* The Internet’s army of recappers seems uncharacteristically unsure of what to make of last night’s episode, complete with company-sponsored juicing, exhaustion-fueled hallucinations, and a song and dance number from Kenneth Cosgrove. But I have a crackpot theory: After a season that began by teasing a year of violence in Vietnam , this episode’s trip down the rabbit hole finally led to that distant war abroad—a “fever dream” treatment of the nation’s panic not unlike the show’s treatment of the Kennedy assassination —or at least that’s how I’d explain everything that went down at the office.
That’s where most of the episode takes place, with Draper, Chaough, and co. faced with an uphill, years-long battle—to conquer the apparently impossible demands of Chevrolet—that they’re deluding themselves they can win. On some level they all seem to know they can’t do it. Early on, someone notes that they need to recruit more men. But instead they press on with blind optimism, on the grounds of what they see as their heretofore perfect record. That’s how Don sees it, anyway: “In my heart I know we cannot be defeated,” he says, in a delirious rallying speech that seems oddly hawkish for an ad agency. Some say their work will take several years, he explains, but all it will really take is an idea. If only they could figure out what that idea was.
If the company is blind to its doomed mission, Kenneth Cosgrove starts the episode literally blinded, with hands over his eyes and a gun to his head. His faceless bosses at Chevrolet are forcing the young man to race into danger, though all he wants to do is go home. When this campaign leaves him injured—the first casualty of the Chevy account—and he returns home hobbling around on a cane, he’s left like a Vietnam veteran: No one understands or cares about his injuries, mental or physical. It’s this experience that drives him into a fugue of tap dance, in which he complains about having had guns fired by his head. Still, he carries on, because that’s company orders.
To boost morale and keep the troops alert through the battle, Jim Cutler calls in Dr. Hex to administer amphetamines. In addition to paralleling an actual New York doctor, Max Jacobson aka Dr. Feelgood , who was later exposed for keeping the city’s rich and famous (not to mention John F. Kennedy) fueled on amphetamines, Hex’s practices also mirror those of the U.S. Armed Forces, which administered amphetamines to sleep-deprived soldiers during Vietnam . As Cutler puts it, when telling Don to see Dr. Hex, “that’s an order.”
Just as unusual is the appearance of Frank Gleason’s hippie daughter, Wendy, who shows up to administer to a different set of needs. We first see her come on to Don, who doesn’t mince words when describing her: “Every time we get a car, this place turns into a whorehouse!” he complains, referring to Wendy’s advances as well as a number of other recent Mad Men events. While Wendy’s choices of reading material (the I Ching ) and recreation ( I Ching coin divination ) are not out of character for a hippie, they also code her promiscuous character as Eastern, like the prostitutes who sprung up around American servicemen stationed in Vietnam. (The I Ching is Chinese in origin, but it’s also a key text in Vietnamese culture.)
Finally, at the center of this maelstrom is Stan, who spends the episode trying to forget about his cousin, whom he reveals was killed in action. This perhaps explains why he spends the episode (just as he has much of the season) dressed in a green, two-pocketed shirt, not unlike those worn by soldiers like his cousin. (Ken, too, wears an unusual, camo-colored tie.) At one point in his deranged sadness he even plays a game of William-Tell-meets-Russian-roulette, which for me couldn’t help but bring to mind another image of Vietnam trauma, perhaps the most iconic in our culture:

Toward the end of the episode, when Stan confesses his grief over Vietnam to Peggy, Peggy responds with some sage advice: “You have to let yourself feel it. You can’t dampen it with drugs and sex.” Stan doesn’t follow Peggy’s advice—instead, he pays a visit to Wendy—and no one else does, either.
Update, May 20, 2:45 p.m.: Vulture points to yet another apparent allusion to Vietnam made by Stan’s William Tell scene. When Ed Gifford says that Stan is “gonna look like St. Sebastian,” he conjures up this iconic Esquire cover featuring Muhammad Ali , posed like St. Sebastian, martyred by arrows. The cover appeared only weeks before the events of this episode, in April 1968, for a story about Ali’s arrest for evading the draft.
Correction, May 20, 2013: This post originally identified Don Draper's new account as being with Chrysler. It is with Chevrolet.

Ray Manzarek, far right, with the other members of the Doors at the Golden Gate Bridge.
Ray Manzarek, the founding member and keyboard player for the Doors whose haunting and sweetly melodic organ riffs loomed large in the psychedelic rock era, died Monday at the RoMed Clinic in Rosenheim, Germany. He was 74.
The cause was bile duct cancer, said a spokeswoman for the band, Heidi Robinson-Fitzgerald. She said the musician had struggled with complications related to the disease for several months and that his wife, Dorothy, and his brothers, Rick and James, were at his bedside when he died.
The Doors were one of rock music’s most renowned and controversial acts. Formed in 1965, when Mr. Manzarek had a chance encounter with aspiring poet and film student Jim Morrison at Venice Beach, the band went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide, with hits like “Light My Fire,” “Hello, I Love You,” “Break on Through (To the Other Side),” “L.A. Woman” and “Roadhouse Blues.”
The Doors first came to San Francisco in January 1967 to open for the Young Rascals and Sopwith Camel at the Fillmore Auditorium. They also frequented local venues such as the Avalon Ballroom and Matrix Club, with bootleg recordings from the shows long circulating among fans.
When they performed a series of dates at the Winterland Ballroom in December 1967, the band stopped one of their shows midsong so could watch themselves perform on TV on “The Jonathan Winters Show.”
After Morrison’s death in Paris in 1971, the Doors – which also included drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger – tried to carry on with Mr. Manzarek on vocals.
When they eventually split up, Mr. Manzarek became a best-selling author and solo artist. He also produced music for Echo and the Bunnymen and the Los Angeles band X, and performed with San Francisco poet Michael McClure, British actor Darryl Read and electronic composer Bal.
His memoir, “Light My Fire: My Life with the Doors,” was published in 1998.
Raymond Daniel Manzarek Jr. was born on Feb. 12, 1939, in Chicago. He initially wanted to play basketball but refused to play guard, despite his coach’s insistence, so he quit the sport. He graduated from DePaul University with a degree in economics. In 1962, he began studying cinematography at UCLA, along with Morrison. He also met his future wife, Dorothy Fujikawa, there.
The Doors staged several hugely successful comebacks over the years, fueled by the Jim Morrison biography “No One Here Gets Out Alive,” co-written by the band’s manager, Danny Sugerman, and Oliver Stone’s sensationalized 1991 biopic, “The Doors.”
The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
In 2000, the band was the subject of the tribute album “Stoned Immaculate” and a live VH1 special – both of which featured lead singers from contemporary bands such as Stone Temple Pilots, Creed and Smash Mouth filling in for Morrison.
Mr. Manzarek shared his thoughts on the enduring appeal of the Doors in an article in The San Francisco Chronicle about 40 years after the band first broke. “I love how the young people of today can understand and get excited by the Doors’ music,” he said. “I love that. I think it’s a tribute to their intellect.”
He added, “People always ask me, ‘But don’t you get tired of playing “Light My Fire”?’ I always say back, ‘Do you get tired of having sex?’ ”
In 2002, Mr. Manzarek revitalized his touring career with Doors’ guitarist and longtime collaborator Krieger as Manzarek-Krieger.
“I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today,” Krieger said in a prepared statement. “I’m just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life, and I will always miss him.”
In 2008, Mr. Manzarek moved to Napa, often sitting in with local acts.
In another interview with The Chronicle, he recalled his last dream about Morrison.
“He was back, and nobody asked him where he had been,” Mr. Manzarek recalled. “He comes in, and we’re in a rehearsal studio, sort of like the Doors workshop. It’s like what he said to me on the beach before we put the band together. I said to him, ‘What have you been up to?’ And he said, ‘I’ve been writing songs.’ And that’s the point at which the dream ends. I never hear the songs. It’s so frustrating. I wake up just before Jim begins to sing, and I never get to hear the songs.”
Mr. Manzarek is survived by his wife and brothers, as well as a son, Pablo, and three grandchildren, Noah, Apollo and Camille. Funeral arrangements are pending.
In lieu of flowers, the family asks fans to please make a memoriam donation in Ray Manzarek’s name at www.standup2cancer.org

A Canadian citizen is being held in jail in Kentucky charged with stalking and threatening Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrenceand her family.
Han Cong Zhao, 23, a former university student from Vancouver, is being held on $100,000 bail in the Jefferson County jail in Louisville, USA Today has reported.
Prosecutors say Zhao sent more than 200 messages and a threatening voicemail to the actress’s brother Blaine Lawrence, telling him: “I find you or you come to me. You got me really upset. When I am upset, wait and see what happens.”
USA Today reported that Zhao flew to Lousiville last month and asked police how he could contact Lawrence’s parents. He also referred to the Hunger Games actress as his “biblical Mary,” court records show.
Judge Annette Karem described the threats against Jennifer Lawrence, who won a best actress Oscar for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, and her family as a “serious danger,” and she ordered Zhao to have no contact with them — “no letters, no emails, no voice messages, no texts, no flowers.”
Zhao has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to face trial July 23.
A lawyer for the Lawrence family said they were co-operating with police and prosecutors but asked that their privacy be respected. “This is not something they invited.”
Jennifer Lawrence grew up in Louisville and has spoken previously about her strong ties to her hometown.

The 'American Hustle' actor and his family arrived after spending time in NYC, filming scenes from his upcoming David O. Russell flick.
The 39-year-old "American Hustle" actor, who is widely known to go through extreme appearance changes for his movie roles, looked nothing like the red carpet ready "Dark Knight Rises" star he'd previously been.

Christian Bale had a very different look in his last big film, ‘The Dark Knight Rises.’
Bale and his family returned to L.A. after spending time in New York City shooting scenes for "American Hustle," the upcoming David O. Russell film — which also stars Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Robert De Niro.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2013/may/20/arrested-development-season-four-netflix-sitcom|Now the story of an amazing TV show,
That got cancelled,
And the cast and fans who had no choice,
But to keep the faith that it would one, day come back,
It's ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT .
Chances are, you are among the majority of people who would read the above paragraph and wonder not just what on earth I am talking about, but why I am saying it in a strange sing-songy tone.
However, you might be among that special – and growing – minority who definitely do understand it and are now sing-songing along to the theme song of a certain TV show that I have scandalously bastardised. If so, you are doubtless squealing with excitement that, after a seven-year wait that has been peppered with raised hopes and broken promises, in less than a week you can see the long-awaited new series of Arrested Development, the finest – in my opinion – sitcom ever produced.
As you can probably ascertain from the above hyperbole – and there will be a lot of hyperbole in this piece, all justified – I am very much part of the minority. I can't remember when I first saw Arrested Development but it has been a rare week (or day) since that I have failed to watch at least three episodes on my now worn-down-to-the-nub box set. That person in the corner barking out catchphrases such as: "I think I've made a huge mistake," "Her?" and, of course, "Come ON!" – no, that's not some teenage boy, that would be me, adult woman me.
Arrested Development is to the US what The Office is to Britain: a small, weird show that came out of nowhere, somehow sneaked onto a major network and influenced many of the best programmes that followed in its wake. It is Modern Family 's older, smarter, funnier, weirder, braver and more original brother ("Hermano!" Arrested fans are shouting as one – unlikely catchphrases are a cornerstone of the show), and its first three series, which aired 2003-6, still look miles ahead of most things on TV today.
Way back in 2002, director Ron Howard came up with the idea of a family-based sitcom filmed documentary-style, using handheld cameras and no laugh track (bear in mind that this was just one year after The Office aired in Britain and years before this style descended into cliche in British and American sitcoms). He hired Mitch Hurwitz to write the show and Hurwitz, inspired by the then-recent Enron scandal, came up with the idea of a once wealthy and deeply corrupt family, the Bluths, who are now in self-induced financial dire straits. The main characters are middle brother Michael (Jason Bateman), who is – generally – a good guy and is trying to rescue his family; his nerdy son George Michael (Michael Cera), who is crippled with guilt about his lustful feelings for his cousin, Maeby Funke (Alia Shawkat); Maeby's selfish mother, Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), and her possibly closeted husband, Tobias (David Cross); Michael's oldest brother, Gob, pronounced like the Biblical "Job" (Will Arnett), a magician whose personal uselessness is only exceeded by the crapness of his tricks; Michael's youngest brother, Buster (Tony Hale), who has been babied into permanent ineptitude by their terrifying mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter); and their now convicted and frequently fugitive father, George Senior (Jeffrey Tambor). Then there are the peripheral but  essential characters, such as Lucille 2 , Buster's occasional girlfriend, played by, of all people, Liza Minnelli, and Barry Zuckercorn (Henry Winkler), the family's useless lawyer, eventually replaced by Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio, who played Winkler's cousin on Happy Days – the show is full of such winks.) Holding the whole shebang together is Ron Howard's dry narration.
Alia Shawkat as Maeby.
This summary barely touches on the brilliance of Arrested Development, and why those of us who love it love it so much. It is a show with a warm heart but a ruthlessly hilarious mind, and the mind always trumps the heart: happy endings are not guaranteed but dark humour definitely is. British TV viewers are relatively used to seeing irredeemably eccentric characters and TV shows that don't condescend to the audience, but on American TV in 2003, this was all wildly subversive.
Too subversive for Fox, it turned out, who – despite the show winning several Emmys – cancelled it in 2006. No, Arrested never got the kind of ratings that other Fox stalwarts such as American Idol attracted (although this wasn't helped by Fox frequently moving the show around the schedule so even the few fans it had could never find it) but, by all reports, the folks in charge never got the programme – it was just too weird. By the time the axe finally fell on Arrested at the end of the third series, the only surprise to the beleaguered cast and crew was that it hadn't fallen sooner.
There have since been frequent rumours of a comeback and maybe even a film, but the fans grew used to disappointment and the show's cult status only grew.
But finally, against all odds, the Bluths are coming back this Sunday, with all the episodes of the new series available at once on Netflix . To celebrate this fact, most of the cast came to London earlier this month and I, of course, behaved with utmost professionalism, causing only one cast member to run away from me in fear of my fangirl ardour. Possibly.
On a rare sunny spring day in London, five of Arrested's main cast members – Jeffrey Tambor, David Cross, Michael Cera, Tony Hale and Alia Shawkat – gather in various hotel rooms in Claridges, all of which looked disconcertingly like Lucille Bluth's baroque apartment. I speak with them in small groups, then all together, then one on one and the dynamics change distinctly and, in many ways, predictably.
"We are all," Hale concedes, "smaller versions of our characters."
Michael Cera as George Michael.
And they really are: on his own Cera is quiet and even nervy. When I ask him about the years 2007–10 when Cera appeared to be ubiquitous, he replies, deeply George Michaelishly: "Well, I enjoyed working. But I don't think anyone wants that kind of attention."
But with Shawkat, whom he describes as one of his closest friends, he comes alive. Shawkat, meanwhile, is the same delightful mix of unfettered bolshiness ("I wanted to prove myself when we got back together [for the fourth series] so was like, hey! I've had drugs! I've had sex!") and insecurity ("When I was 16 and on the show, I hated my body, I was so insecure and used to smoke pot all the time …") that defines Maeby. In a group, Hale is as self-effacing as Buster being terrorised by his mother – but on his own he's a gigglesome, gossipy joy.
Tambor always dominates whatever group he's in, but alone he's solemn and elusive and at one point I find myself chasing him up some stairs just to try to talk to him, as though I were pursuing George Sr through Mexico in the second series. I worry that perhaps I scared him off but Cera and Shawkat assure me there is a definite overlap between Tambor and George Sr: on his very first day on set back in 2003, when he was still a nervous 14-year-old, Cera brought his mother and saw Tambor walking towards them and so he shyly said: "Uh, Jeffrey, this is my mother." "I'm not interested in meeting your fucking mother," Tambor replied and walked all the way to the end of the room before turning around and coming back to kiss her. Similarly, Shawkat recalls the time when she was just 15 and the show lost a SAG award to Desperate Housewives. Tambor turned to her and snarled: "This is all your fault," before finishing his pudding, without winking once. (Tambor, for his part, thinks he's "a lot more like Oscar", George Sr's hippy twin brother, than George Sr.)
"The adults definitely didn't soften things on set. You get a thick skin but it's not a tough place – it's just that some of the stuff they would say was really coarse and extreme," says Cera. (Surprisingly, Arnett isn't the coarsest but rather it is, according to Cera, angel-faced Bateman: "Jason is a complete terror. The things that come out of his mouth!")
Finally, Cross is mouthy and hilarious. He doesn't drop any Tobias-style double entendres ("I just blue myself"), but his words often reveal more than he initially intends. While the rest of the cast offer placating platitudes about how at least Fox kept the show going for three series, Cross tries to do the same but invariably his sentences collapse into still palpable frustration:
"You know, Fox isn't in the business of making great art – they're in the business of making as much money as possible for Rupert Murdoch. Which, of course, is what all of our business should be," he finishes with more than a hint of bite.
Having crossed the Murdoch rubicon, Cross then gleefully recounts the morning in 2003 when they were shooting the pilot:
Jeffrey Tambor as George Senior.
"So I was in make up at 6am and I had this moustache for Tobias. But we get a message that someone – well, I guess you can Google who it was, it was Gail Berman [then the president of entertainment for Fox] – has three rules about men in comedy : no moustaches, no frilly cuffs, no hats. Just the most absurd, arbitrary … Anyway, we went back and forth and eventually they say: 'OK, you can have a moustache, but it can't be bushy.' That was an actual quote!" Inevitably, not only does Tobias have a moustache in the pilot, but he wears frilly cuffs, too, and hats were not far behind.
By contrast, Cross says, Netflix "could not have been more vocal in their appreciation for what we do". And they have lavished a lot more than compliments on the show: not only did they put up its cast members in Claridge's, they held an Arrested Development party in Sketch, one of London's most absurdly overpriced restaurants. (By comparison, when Arrested won one of its Emmys back in 2004, the most Fox could manage was a tiny "Congratulations!" banner of the kind that you get in a party store, and they took it down by the end of the day.)
After Fox shut the show down in 2006, most of the cast members assumed it had been forgotten, only occasionally getting approached by college students. But slowly the show's cult status grew ("It's probably better that Fox didn't give us more seasons as getting cancelled gave us that underdog cult status," says Shawkat, treacherously but also probably correctly.) Now people around the world shout out their characters' catchphrases to them ("In India, while I was meditating – what the fuck!" cries Shawkat). In return for such loyalty, they are all sweetly discreet about plot developments in the fourth series, fearful of spoiling their fans' pleasure.
They all insist that they had such innate trust in Hurwitz that, when he finally confirmed there would be a fourth series, they agreed immediately. With one exception: cautious, nervous Buster, I mean Hale. "So many years had gone by, so many expectations, I didn't know if I could do it ..."
Hale is also now starring in Veep, Armando Iannucci's HBO sitcom, complicating his schedule further: "And Armando and Mitch are so different in their approaches. With Armando, he's so sweet and each show morphs as we film it. Whereas Mitch is like a comic scientist and you don't want to improvise because everything is so precisely worked out."
Ultimately, though, everyone got back on board, but it would have been understandable if the cast had more qualms than the fans about the return. For a start, the scripts were often completed on the fly while filming. Complicating matters further, because all 15 episodes will be available at once Hurwitz has decided to play with the most basic structural principles of a sitcom: instead of the various story arcs concluding at the end of each episode, they will reach through the whole series. This means fans will have to be especially alert at spotting the in-jokes, and patient that the various nonsensical utterances the characters are saying will, at some point, become logical, although that point may not be for several hours.
But Arrested's fans and cast have practice at being patient and putting their faith into Hurwitz's seemingly most deranged ideas:
"From the start it was like, 'OK, now a seal's going to eat your hand and Liza Minnelli's going to be your girlfriend,' and I'd be like, 'OK.' You just ride that wave," shrugs Hale. It's time, at last, to ride that wave again.

With more than 60 years in the laughs business, Mel Brooks is a national treasure: He's one of only 14 people who've won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony (EGOT) -- and he's directed, written, produced and acted in some of the best comedies ever. It's hard to imagine, but what would the entertainment world be like if Brooks had chosen another profession?
In an outtake from "Mel Brooks: Make A Noise," the PBS American Masters documentary on the icon premiering May 20 at 9 p.m. EST/PST, Brooks ponders the question himself. "American Masters" documentary on Mel Brooks sees the legend giving unprecedented access to his life's story, charting his professional and personal highs and lows with interviews from Brooks himself and his famous cadre of friends and collaborators, like Carl Reiner and Matthew Broderick .
"My mother knew a trade was something," Brooks said in the video above. "You'll have a job, you'll be able to mary and eat..."
To hear the career path a young Brooks almost followed -- and his big regret about being a comedian instead -- watch the video above.

Who were those three familiar Seventies faces spotted at Cincinnati-area amusement park Kings Island on Sunday? Marcia, Marcia, Marcia? Well ... no. But close.

Susan Olsen (Cindy), Christopher Knight (Peter) and Barry Williams (Greg) ride The Racer rollercoaster at Kings Island with Kevin Brunck, manager of entertainment for the park. The actors were paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of the "Brady Bunch" episode shot at the park.
Three now-grown "Brady Bunch" kids returned to the Mason, Ohio park on Sunday, nearly 40 years after they filmed a classically campy 1973 episode there.
"The Kings Island episode is one of my favorite episodes from the Brady Bunch, right up there with the episode shot in Hawaii and the Return of Johnny Bravo," said Barry Williams, who played oldest brother Greg.
You remember the plot, such that it was. Architect dad Mike flew the fam from California to Ohio where his firm was building an addition to Kings Island, then only in its second year of existence. Typical Brady hijinx ensue, and somehow middle sister Jan ends up with Mike's blueprints and Mike unrolls Jan's Yogi Bear poster at his meeting. Sadly, the park honchos didn't seem enamored with the idea of a bear-shaped add-on, and Mike's klutzy kids had put his job in danger once again.
But never fear, it's Bradys to the rescue! The family sets off in a relay race across the park, with even beloved and exercise-averse maid Alice zooming off to find the plans and get them to Mike in time.
The episode became a cast and fan favorite with plenty of memorable moments. Jan's plaid pants! Greg falling for a park employee and agreeing to parade around dressed in an animal costume! Alice getting dizzy after swinging around in a giant beer barrel on a Tilt-A-Whirl type ride! Bobby and Cindy eating, and eating, and eating!

Barry Williams teaches Kings Island patrons the patented Brady family choreography to "Sunshine Day."
Along with Williams, Susan Olsen, who played Cindy, and Christopher Knight, who played Peter, showed up to ride the rides and sign autographs. The cast members performed four sold-out shows for park visitors, with Williams singing his Eminem parody song, "The Real Greg Brady" and teaching the audience the choreography to that Brady musical classic, "Sunshine Day."
Williams told Cincinnati's ABC affiliate that the show's appeal is multigenerational. "It's really a treat to talk to people who watched us in first-run, there's a whole generation who watched us after school, and as you can see there's a whole upcoming generation watching on DVD," he said.
And Olsen told the station that the trip was a time warp. "We just assume our original roles -- not our character roles -- but our roles amongst each other," she said. "And we’re back to being kids."

Toots Hibbert of Toots and the Maytals.
A Richmond, Va. area man was charged on Sunday with aggravated assault and public intoxication after throwing a bottle at reggae singer Frederick "Toots" Hibbert during  a concert Saturday, reported The Richmond Times-Dispatch .
Toots, who fronts Toots and the Maytals, were performing at the Dominion Riverrock Outdoor Sports and Music Festival when William C. Lewis, 19, reportedly threw a glass vodka bottle from the crowd. The set ended early.
"I was on stage at the sound monitor desk when a clear glass liquor bottle struck Toots Hibbert in the head," said John O'Donnell, who works for Soundworks, which co-produced the event. "Blood was flowing heavily from his head."
A guitarist told the crowd that Hibbert was "going to the hospital with a busted head."
Workers discovered that a vodka bottle had disappeared from a bar, said Jack Berry, executive director of Venture Richmond, which co-produced the event.
Hibbert, 67, was treated at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, then released early on Sunday morning, and appears to hold no grudge against the area, according to festival manager Stephen Lecky.
"He was in good spirits and was very appreciative of Richmond," he said. "He said he wanted to come back, and he understood this was just one bad apple, basically."
Added Lecky, "He was one of the nicest men I ever met."
The band's Facebook page featured a post late on Sunday which read: "Toots would like to thank all his friends, fans and family who have reached out to him since the bottle throwing incident in Richmond Saturday Night. After 7 seven stitches and a little rest he was able to perform a wonderful show in Westhampton NY tonite as the 1st show of his acoustic tour. The youth who threw the bottle for no apparent reason is in custody and being charged. Being the soldier he is he will hopefully be able to continue the tour."

He says that he loves his son unconditionally, but he won't give up drugs to have a relationship with his son. He's also put a condition on the relationship= that there are no conditions in order to be in his son's life. DMX is putting his inner darkness ahead of what he truly wants, and that's a family that LOVES him. They obviously do... but he doesn't want to have to love and accept others in the same capacity as he﻿ wants to be loved and accepted. He needs to save himself.

http://www.salon.com/2013/05/19/colin_quinns_unconstitutional_an_unconventional_history_lesson_partner/|This article originally appeared on International Business Times .
Historical mockery has become something of a running theme for “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Colin Quinn. In 2010, he premiered his Off Broadway examination of world history, “Long Story Short.” Now, Quinn is back with a new historically minded hour of entertainment in  “Unconstitutional,”  playing now at New York City’s Barrow Street Theater.
In just over an hour, Quinn’s “Unconstitutional” takes the audience on an irreverent journey through the entire United States Constitution and its Bill of Rights. Sure, the Constitution might not sound like a particularly hilarious topic, but it’s much more than a history lesson with Quinn. 
So why focus this special on the Constitution?
“It’s the one thing that we’re all experts about, which is amazing because none of us have read it,” Quinn explains at the start of the show.
Thankfully for everyone involved, the show is just as much about modern America as it is about the country’s founding. Yes, Quinn throws in jokes about Cyrus Griffin and the Articles of Confederation, but there’s still plenty of commentary on the Kardashians and Maury Povich to keep the show accessible.
Throughout “Unconstitutional,” one metaphor keeps recurring: The Constitution was conceived as a result of a months-long drinking binge — “scrawled on the back of a napkin,” Quinn says — and American history is all too much like a blurry night out at the bar.
It’s a metaphor that works equally well for “Unconstitutional” itself. At his best moments in the show, Quinn’s performance becomes less of a polished theatrical monolog and more of a brilliant, spontaneous drunken rant. Quinn has all the enthusiasm and candor of an impassioned barfly, but much more wit and composure than most could hope for.
Quinn has other comedic weapons aside from his earnestness, however. Other times in “Unconstitutional,” Quinn dissects popular language in a style reminiscent of George Carlin’s best moments. According to Quinn, a politician can get away with just about anything as long as he throws around seemingly meaningless buzzwords like “sustainability,” “transparency” and “accountability.”
For a show about America’s political history, Quinn wisely veers away from any explicitly partisan jokes. In fact, one of the biggest themes of the show is that America has become too embroiled in political extremism. Moderates used to be the norm, he says, but now Americans don’t trust anyone willing to compromise.
As for Quinn’s own political ideologies, he describes himself as somewhat of a mutt. Quinn confesses that he is pro–gun ownership, pro–gay marriage, pro–death penalty and pro-abortion. The common theme linking them all together?
“I’m anti-overcrowding,” he says.
Though “Unconstitutional” isn’t perfect — it starts off a bit slow, and sometimes Quinn’s darker jokes don’t land well — it’s a highly entertaining and well-thought out show. Quinn is frequently hilarious and always amusing.

It is a peculiar experience meeting the most famous faceless musicians in the world. Daft Punk are certainly well known. Eight years after their last album, their influence can be felt throughout dance music and beyond. Their fourth release, Random Access Memories, is the most hysterically anticipated record in years: every tidbit disseminated online over the past two months has been scrutinised like a fragment of the true cross. At a point in their career when most bands are on a downward slope, Daft Punk have just celebrated their first number one single, "Get Lucky", and are somehow bigger than ever.
"They're two of the greatest innovators in popular music and we're as excited to hear what they are doing as we are about David Bowie," says Chris Price, music editor of industry trade magazine Record of the Day. "I think they're as enigmatic and pioneering as Kraftwerk," says  Dave Clarke, whose Soma label discovered Daft Punk 20 years ago. "They drop out and disappear and their fanbase grows."
So, yes, Daft Punk are very famous indeed, but the two Frenchmen sitting side by side on a sofa in a luxurious Paris hotel suite – Thomas Bangalter, 38, and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, 39 – are very much not. Their last unmasked photo shoot was in 1995 and, for the past decade or so, they have hidden inside the helmets of their robot alter egos. But helmets would look, well, daft in an interview so here they are in the reluctant flesh. With his receding hairline, grey jacket and lean, thoughtful face, Thomas has a professorial air, delivering smoothly erudite monologues in a voice rather like Vincent Cassel's. Slumped beside him, in black jeans and a T-shirt advertising Italian prog-rock band Goblin, Guy-Man looks and acts at least a decade younger, long-haired and taciturn, like a problematic exchange student. It feels as if a hip TV academic has, for his own quiet amusement, decided to bring his surly nephew to work  for the day.
Of course, Daft Punk would argue that any impression of them as people is irrelevant. "The robots are part of the fiction and it's not really interesting to see what's behind it," argues Thomas. "When you look at C-3PO and Darth Vader and then look at the actors behind them you can't really make the connection. It kills the magic. I feel the robots are the same." Guy-Man grunts in agreement. "They're more interesting than us for sure."
Five years in the making, Random Access Memories is a fabulously, heroically, sometimes ridiculously ambitious enterprise. First there's the cast of guests, which includes disco pioneers ( Giorgio Moroder , Nile Rodgers ), indie-rock stars (the Strokes's Julian Casablancas , Animal Collective's Panda Bear ), house producers ( Todd Edwards , DJ Falcon ) R&B royalty ( Pharrell Williams ) and a singer-songwriter who wrote songs for Bugsy Malone and the Muppets ( Paul Williams ). Then there's the sheer sonic opulence, attained by snubbing computers in favour of veteran session musicians, legendary studios and a 70-piece orchestra. Finally there's the promotional campaign, which involves costumes designed by Hedi Slimane , billboards on Sunset Boulevard and a series of playfully ingenious teasers starting in March with an enigmatic commercial during Saturday Night Live. Set against most of the year's "big" releases, Random Access Memories resembles Gulliver in Lilliput.
"The first thing I said when I heard it was: 'Can I see it again?'" Paul Williams says in awestruck tones. "That's an interesting slip of the tongue. The best way I can describe it is Kubrick's 2001. They take you back in time and then they take you into the future."
Five years ago, Daft Punk surveyed the music industry's diminished landscape of slashed budgets, shuttered studios, MP3s and Garage Band loops and decided to do the exact opposite, inspired by the musical Everests that dominated their childhood, from Dark Side of the Moon to Thriller. It's significant that the final track on Random Access Memories, "Contact", samples the voice of Captain Eugene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, because the album betrays a fervent longing for the days of giant leaps.
"The music that's being done today has lost its magic and its poetry because it's rooted in everyday life and is highly technological," Thomas says with a sorrowful expression. "Then you have this classic repertoire of great music that feels like it's coming from this other, timeless place. We wanted to say that these classic albums that were ambitious in scope don't just belong to the past."

It is a grand throw of the dice for a pair of shy, stubborn Frenchmen who started out making noisy techno in their bedrooms. They could have saved themselves a great deal of time and money (they funded it themselves, only later partnering with Columbia Records) by making an album of catchy dance-pop, but they chose the hard way. If their 1997 debut, Homework, reshaped dance music and the impact of 2001's Discovery, a love letter to disco and soft-rock, is still echoing through pop now, then their hope for Random Access Memories is to inspire other artists to dream big. "It's only a state of mind to globally change," says Thomas.
Before I met Daft Punk I spoke to Giorgio Moroder, the 73-year-old producer behind such electronic milestones as Donna Summer's "I Feel Love". "I don't know very much about Guy-Man because we barely spoke, but Thomas is an incredibly intellectual guy," he told me. "He explains things in a metaphysical way. Sometimes it's a little difficult to know exactly what he means."
According to Thomas, Random Access Memories is like a movie, a painting, a fashion collection or "going on a journey in a small boat but you don't know if you're going to reach the other shore". Guy-Man, meanwhile, says precisely nothing for the first half-hour, preferring to sip his espresso, text, stare at the ceiling and generally pretend that I'm not there, his face naturally arranging itself into a weary scowl.
Thomas says that, when they were composing the score for 2010's Tron: Legacy, he wrote the "good guy" themes while Guy-Man handled the "bad guy" music. This makes a lot of sense.
Eventually, in desperation, I ask Guy-Man if he agrees with Thomas last answer. "Yes," he says witheringly. "If I disagree I will tell you." I ask him why he's stayed silent. "Silence is better," he shrugs, and Thomas laughs.
Daft Punk have never relished talking about themselves. In early interviews they came across as suspicious and aloof. "It's because you're 18 and you feel maybe guilty: why are we chosen to do these things?" says Thomas. "There's definitely reasons to feel less uncomfortable now. It's one thing to say you're going to do it and another to have done it for 20 years."
The duo met in 1987 at Paris's Lycée Carnot, prestigious alma mater of Jacques Chirac and Dominique Strauss-Kahn. "We were still children so we formed each other," says Guy-Man, finally surrendering to the interview. "There's so much that is unspoken. It's like an odd  couple. Some couples will argue until they die, but some don't speak and enjoy looking at the sunset, you know?"
Thomas's father, Daniel Vangarde, produced French disco hits in the 70s – "DISCO" for Ottawan and "Cuba" for the Gibson Brothers – and Guy-Man's worked in advertising; they shared a privileged upbringing. Their first loves were Jimi Hendrix, the Velvet Underground and Phantom of the Paradise , the bizarre 1974 musical horror movie that Brian De Palma made with Paul Williams. "It covered everything we liked when we were teenagers: horror, rock, musicals, glam," says Thomas, glowing with fandom. "Listening to Led Zeppelin songs backwards, watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre on VHS and getting KISS and David Bowie albums. It synthesised all of these elements."
In 1992, they formed a lo-fi rock band called Darlin' (after a Beach Boys song) with their friend Laurent Brancowitz, who now plays guitar in the successful French group Phoenix. Darlin' released just a handful of songs, which were dismissed as "daft punky thrash" by the music paper Melody Maker. Tweaking this insult into their new name, Thomas and Guy-Man switched to basic electronic equipment purchased with Thomas's 18th birthday present of £1,000, and released three singles on the Scottish dance label Soma, including the groundbreaking "Da Funk".
"Thomas did all the talking," remembers Soma founder Dave Clarke. "For the first six months I knew him Guy-Man kind of pretended he couldn't speak English. They liked being out but they weren't big drinkers. They were quite frugal. They didn't have a desire for wealth and glamour. They had a relaxed confidence that their music was going to get out there."
This was a period when the likes of the Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers were proving that dance music could transcend clubland to deliver big-selling crossover albums. When major labels came running, they were made to feel that they needed Daft Punk more than Daft Punk needed them. "Our career is defined more by the things we didn't do than by the things we did," says Thomas. "A lot of young kids come to us and say, 'What can we do to be where you guys are? We'll do anything.'
"And the answer is just the opposite. We haven't done anything that we didn't want. The only secret to being in control is to have it in the beginning. Retaining control is still hard, but obtaining control is  virtually impossible."
Daft Punk's outsider mentality owed something to coming from France, whose pop music was then the butt of condescending jokes in the UK press and whose rave scene was hounded by the authorities. "Initially electronic music was anti-establishment, as punk rock and rock'n'roll were," says Thomas. "The music was shut down, the police were against the parties." He sounds like a soixante-huitard fondly remembering the barricades. "Now it's the opposite. It been totally accepted so there's nothing to fight for."
Daft Punk's 1997 debut album, Homework, recorded entirely in Thomas's bedroom, filtered house and techno through a love of classic rock. The cover displayed a logo patch sewn on to a black satin jacket, while the inner sleeve depicted a desk cluttered with adolescent artefacts, including a 1976 KISS poster and a Chic single sleeve. It was like a superhero's origin story: Peter Parker's bedroom before he became Spider-Man. Guy-Man, who designed the artwork, says that Thomas is the "hands-on technician" while he is the "filter": the man who stands back and says oui or non.
The hit single "Around the World" displayed a then-unfashionable love of disco which attracted the attention of Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers. "The genius is never in the writing, it's in the rewriting," says Rodgers. "Whenever they put out records I can hear the amount of work that's gone into them – those microscopically small decisions that other people won't even think about. It's cool, but they massage it so it's not just cool – it's amazing."
For the next few years, Daft Punk could do no wrong. They commissioned striking videos from Spike Jonze , Michel Gondry and Roman Coppola . "Music Sounds Better With You", the Chaka Khan-sampling 1998 single by Thomas's side project Stardust , brought disco fever to house music. Madonna and Kylie had number-one hits that sounded uncannily like Daft Punk. In 2001 the retro-futurist Discovery revived appreciation for the kind of glossy soft-rock and sentimental 80s pop that most bands deemed too cheesy. "Homework was really to show the rock kids that techno is cool and Discovery was to show the techno kids that rock and soft-rock can be cool," says Thomas. It worked. They were sampled by Kanye West (whose forthcoming album they've worked on), celebrated as the gold standard of hipster cred in LCD Soundsystem 's "Daft Punk is  Playing at My House" and energetically  homaged by younger artists, such as Justice .
The robot helmets, which are redesigned for each new project and are famous enough to have been spoofed on The Simpsons, enhanced their mystique. "People initially thought it was just marketing," says Thomas. "It was never that. The robots in some sense were as important as the music itself." Of course, it was also great marketing and an excellent way of preserving their privacy. At last month's Coachella festival, while the crowd went wild to a short video clip of "Get Lucky", Daft Punk watched from the sidelines, blissfully unrecognised.
There was a downside to the unbroken acclaim though. The more that other people sounded like Daft Punk, the harder it become for Daft Punk to do something new. Their third album, 2005's rough, ornery Human After All, was poorly received and left Daft Punk unsure what to do next. "Usually a band 20 years into its existence doesn't put out its best records," says Thomas. "That was something we had in mind – to try to break that rule. It's not intimidating, but it takes time."
So Daft Punk stopped thinking about albums. Instead they mounted a groundbreaking world tour, their first since 1997, that did for live dance music what Pink Floyd did for stadium rock. They made an inscrutable, wordless art movie called Daft Punk's Electroma . They scored Tron: Legacy for Disney. They both started families: Thomas has a second home in LA with his actor wife Élodie Bouchez. They reluctantly agreed to be made Chevaliers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, having controversially turned down the prestigious honour several years earlier, just because they didn't want to cause another fuss. "You feel like you're going to get even more attention," Thomas says with an embarrassed sigh.
In the absence of any new Daft Punk music, their back catalogue nourished America's EDM (Electronic Dance Music) explosion. Key producers, such as Skrillex, trace their love of dance music to that 2006-7 tour. "Everyone I've talked to who's seen that show counts it as one of their all-time favourites," says Ryan Dombal, senior editor of influential US music website Pitchfork. "And its uniqueness and relative scarcity makes it easy to mythologise. When a lot of artists are trying to get an audience's attention by any means necessary – Twitter, sponsorship deals, commercials, playing festivals – it's automatically appealing when an artist seems above all that."
Daft Punk, who prefer the likes of James Blake and Bon Iver to most club music, pull faces when I mention their influence on EDM. "Pthrrrrt," says Thomas. "On one hand we're flattered. On the other hand we wish people could be influenced by our approach as much as our output. It's about breaking the rules and doing something different rather than taking some arrangements we did 10 years ago that have now become a formula."
Thomas blames the machines. For a man who has spent 12 years pretending to be a robot, he takes a remarkably dim view of digital music. "Computers aren't really music instruments," he sniffs. "And the only way to listen to it is on a computer as well. Human creativity is the ultimate interface. It's much more powerful than the mouse or the touch screen."
As an antidote to those wretched machines, they recorded Random Access Memories entirely live, with dozens of musicians, in studios in Paris, New York and Los Angeles. That sounds expensive, I say. "Yes, it got expensive," Thomas nods with some pride. "But we started with just £1,000 and everything since then has been financed by the audience. It was expensive in the same way that movies are expensive, because hundreds of people work on them. We feel fortunate to be able to experiment on a large scale. There's a lot of experimentation now in alternative music, but it feels like there's no money. The people with the means to be ambitious are usually the ones who are experimenting less."
Enjoying the Hollywood analogy, Thomas says Daft Punk were the album's screenwriters and directors while the guest performers were the actors, but actors who were given licence to write their own lines. "I didn't feel like I was being brought in to add wallpaper to a house that already existed," says Paul Williams. "I felt part of the process from the very beginning."
The way individual collaborators describe their understanding of the record recalls the fable of the blind men and the elephant: each one grasped only a fraction of the whole. "They didn't tell me anything," says Moroder, who spent four hours talking about his life for the extraordinary disco history lesson "Giorgio By Moroder". "Zero. I had several dinners with the boys and I didn't even ask because I knew they wouldn't tell me."
"What I worked on was quite bare bones and everything else grew up around me," says Nile Rodgers. "They just wanted me to be free to play. That's the way we used to make records back in the day. It almost felt like we'd moved back in time."
Perhaps that's the key to Daft Punk's current mission: using their privileged position to reinvent old methods pour encourager les autres. "We're not in a golden age of audiophile excellence and craftsmanship," complains Thomas. "But there's maybe a way to put back a certain optimism. There's things that can be done with music. It's an invitation to variety."
As for where Daft Punk go from here – will they make another album? Will they ever tour again? They'd really rather not say. "The projection of the future is kind of useless," shrugs Thomas. He thinks a tour, however lucrative, would be a distraction at this point. "We want to put the spotlight on the record. That's what we are sharing with you. There's nothing else." He holds out his empty palms. "That's it."
Guy-Man points out that, after all, they have not got this far by blabbing about their plans. "We don't actively try to feed people and annoy them with what we're doing," he says, leaning back. "We are not craving to be known. If we don't have this or that we are fine. You have to be self-content. The art is the first and only priority." He reclines like a cat in the sun. "We don't have to rush things."
Random Access Memories is out on Columbia on 20 May

JD Salinger's secret life exposed in new documentary
Film promising revelations about reclusive Catcher in the Rye author has been snapped up by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein

JD Salinger , the elusive author of The Catcher in the Rye, was one of America's most famous recluses and guarded his private life with fanatical dedication. Yet even he might have been impressed by the immense efforts being undertaken to keep details secret of a new documentary that has been made about his life and works.
Called simply Salinger, the film is the brainchild of Shane Salerno, who has spent nine years writing, producing and directing the project, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money. The move is a major shift in career for Salerno, best known as a writer of mainstream blockbusters such as Alien vs Predator: Requiem and Armageddon.
But the promise of lifting the lid on the life of one of America's most revered writers has proven a massive lure to Hollywood. Salinger has been bought up by independent film mogul Harvey Weinstein after he reportedly saw a private screening of it at 7.30 on the morning of the Oscars. Even though the screening did not apparently include all of the film's most confidential revelations, he snapped it up immediately.
In fact, so impressed have its backers been with what Salerno and his team have uncovered they are also releasing a TV show based on the documentary and have struck a deal with publisher Simon and Schuster to bring out a book called The Private War of JD Salinger.
With Salerno not giving press interviews, there has been feverish speculation about details of new love affairs and rumours of unpublished manuscripts. One of the few hints is a statement Salerno made announcing the book deal. "The myth that people have read about and believed for 60 years about JD Salinger is one of someone too pure to publish, too sensitive to be touched. We replace the myth of Salinger with an extraordinarily complex, deeply contradictory human being. Our book offers a complete revaluation and reinterpretation of the work and the life," he said.
That is a bold claim to make about one of the world's most elusive figures, who died at the age of 91 in 2010. Though the publication of The Catcher in the Rye in 1951 made him rich and famous, Salinger fled the spotlight. In 1953 he left New York to live in a secluded rural compound in Cornish, New Hampshire. His published literary output dwindled and he eschewed virtually all media interviews. His last published work came out in 1965, and his last interview – which Salinger appeared to have been tricked into giving – was in 1980.
Ironically, many believe Salinger's quest for privacy actually stoked far more fascination. "In keeping himself isolated, it excited people," said Tom Paine, a Salinger fan and the author of a collection of short stories and the novel The Pearl of Kuwait.
Indeed, few authors can claim to have inspired so many people with such a small body of work. His stories seem to have captured the angst of youth and modern life. "He was a writer who was more of a spiritual seeker than just a storyteller. He was trying to use fiction not only to tell a story, but to parallel his own spiritual development," said Paine.
But some have not reacted well to Salerno's project. Though he claims to have interviewed as many as 200 people, Salinger's son, Matthew Salinger, told the New York Times recently that his father's inner circle of friends numbered just a few and none had co-operated with the project. "There were barely enough people to form a circle in the last 30 or 40 years," he told the newspaper.
That comment has drawn a swift rebuttal. In a statement, the Weinstein company said Salerno had gained "unprecedented access" to people around Salinger. "With due respect to Matt Salinger, he has not seen the film. We've seen the film, and unfortunately Matt Salinger does not have accurate information," it said.
Either way, speculation about the film will stoke massive interest in its subject: something that many fans see as a double-edged sword. Certainly, not all intend to watch it, out of a belief that Salinger himself would have been horrified by the idea. "I am very much in two minds about the documentary. It seems deeply wrong, carnivorous and hurtful, even though I am perhaps hungry to know what is in it," said Paine.

Fox has confirmed the long-discussed reboot of Carl Sagan’s landmark documentary series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage starring none other than famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.
According to the LA Times , the network made their announcement on Monday at their upfront presentation. The series will start with 13 episodes, set to air sometime in 2014. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane is attached as a producer.
Sagan’s original Cosmos series is one of the most beloved and popular documentary series in the history of television. Broadcast on PBS in 1980, Cosmos was the most watched series in the public television history until Ken Burns’ The Civil War series overtook that title.
We’ve known that something like this was in the works, as reports of a Cosmos reboot starring Tyson was reported back in 2011 . No additional details emerged at that time, and nearly a year later Tyson confirmed on Twitter that we could expect the new Cosmos series to launch in Spring of 2014.
The new show’s host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is easily the most renowned astrophysicist around. He currently directs the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and has hosted a PBS show before – NOVA ScienceNow from 2006 to 2011. Tyson is also host to the popular StarTalk Radio Show. He’s also a frequent contributor to the alternative nightly show circuit, including The Daily Show, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Oh, and he’s quite popular on the internet .
Earlier this week we learned that Fox is also bringing back the popular action series 24 – but at this point it’s a one-time thing and it will only run 12 more episodes.

Shhhhh! Matt Smith in The Name of the Doctor. Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC
Well that was all a bit Keystone Cops, wasn't it? Our biggest surprise, our most secret episode , a revelation about the Doctor that changes everything ...
... and we'd have got away with it too, if we hadn't accidentally sent Blu-ray copies of Name Of The Doctor to 210 Doctor Who fans in America. Security-wise, that's not GOOD, is it? I mean, it's not top-notch; it's hard to defend as professional-level, hard-line secrecy.
My favourite fact is that they're Blu-Rays. Listen, we don't just leak any old rubbish, we leak in high-def – 1080p or nothing, that's us. Every last pixel in beautifully rendered detail. It's like getting caught extra naked.
But here's the thing. Never mind us blundering fools, check out the fans. Two hundred and ten of them, with the top-secret episode within their grasp – and because we asked nicely, they didn't breathe a word . Not one. Even Doctor Who websites have been closing their comments sections, just in case anyone blurts. I'm gobsmacked. I'm impressed. Actually, I'm humbled. And we are all very grateful.
Now you might be thinking, what does all this matter? It's a plot development in the mad old fantasy world of Doctor Who, why is that important? Well of course, it's not important, and in the scheme of things, it doesn't matter at all. Just as it doesn't matter when you're telling a joke, and some idiot shouts out the punchline before you finish. It's irritating, that's all. It's bad manners.
Well, no bad manners here! Two hundred and ten Doctor Who fans kept the secret, and many, many more fans helped. I wish I could send you all flowers, but I don't know where you live (and, given our record, you really shouldn't be sharing private information with us). So instead, if we can get our act together – and I forgive you for thinking that's a big if – there will be a little video treat released on the Doctor Who site later tonight.
Ten plus 11 gives you ...

IMDB
While most forms of storytelling have remained unchanged over the years—painters still use oil, writers still use words—motion pictures have undergone frequent and radical transformations. Bit by bit, we went from static camera shots of canoodling couples to Avatar, a film that likely would’ve driven 1920s audiences into a mental institution.
Milestones like the introduction of sound, color, and CGI characters have been well-documented; here are eight lesser-known but equally significant evolutions in the art and business of movies.
1. Close Encounters—the Director’s Cut
Though not explicitly labeled “his” version, Steven Spielberg agreed to shoot new footage and restore excised content for a “Special Edition” re-release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1980. In on-the-nose ad campaigns typical of the era, posters promised “there is more” and that Spielberg “has filmed additional scenes,” marking the first time a film was promoted based on the fact that it was a revised work.
Columbia Pictures squeezed another $15 million out of Close Encounters with minimal effort: By the 1990s, home video consumers were flooded with “Director’s Cut” versions of popular films (Blade Runner, Aliens) that allowed filmmakers more leeway—and studios the opportunity to charge cinephiles for the same movie twice.
2. Marathon Man Runs—and the Camera Follows
Prior to Garrett Brown’s invention of the Steadicam —a handheld camera that could move as quickly and fluidly as the person operating it—roaming shots were accomplished using clunky dolly tracks or cranes. Brown wanted more mobility. One of the first films to use his device, Marathon Man, allowed Dustin Hoffman to sprint through city streets while the camera followed, adding a new sense of intimacy and realism to scenes. By the time the Steadicam chased a jogging Sylvester Stallone through Philadelphia in Rocky that same year, filmmakers knew they could take their audiences anywhere.
3. Billy Jack Goes National
Movies today open on thousands of screens simultaneously, but film distribution used to be markedly different: Even large “event” offerings would debut in major cities before slowly rolling out to other parts of the country. It might be months before a family in San Francisco saw what New Yorkers had already experienced.
That strategy annoyed Tom Laughlin, director and star of a series of independent features about a pacifist named Billy Jack who occasionally finds it necessary to kick people in the sternum. For 1974’s Trial of Billy Jack, Laughlin leveraged the popularity of the earlier installments and insisted the film open in 1500 theaters in a single day .
Despite poor reviews, the film raked in millions and major studios took notice. Jaws, opening the following year, rolled out wide and ushered in the concept of the summer blockbuster. Though it’s often credited with instituting the practice, it’s Laughlin who should get the credit—or blame—for vacuuming up revenue on opening weekend.
4. The Addams Family Merges the Small and Big Screens
The 1954 film Dragnet, a big-screen adaptation of the television series starring Jack Webb as stoic Sergeant Joe Friday, was a curiosity: Why should audiences pay for a premise they could see for free on television?
Star Trek had a profitable time in the ‘80s due to pent-up fan demand, but television adaptations were still few and far between until 1991’s The Addams Family, a kitschy homage to the 1960s series about a brood of eccentrics, made a tidy $113 million . In short order, movies based on The Fugitive, Twin Peaks, The Brady Bunch, and dozens of others hit multiplexes, ready to cash in on nostalgia and brand recognition. (Trek, however, remains the king: the 2009 reboot is the highest-grossing TV-to-movie adaptation to date.)
5. Taking Independent Film Out of the Shadows
Forget Kickstarter: Television actor John Cassavetes had to round up improvisational actors and use checks culled from series guest spots to mount Shadows , an independent feature released in 1959 that explored taboo topics like race and sexuality. What he lacked in polish he gained in complete autonomy from the studio system. That do-it-yourself mentality later fed the 1990s emergence of filmmakers like Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, and Spike Lee—knowingly or not, all of them informed by Cassavetes and his urge to express himself without a filter.
6. Snow White’s Creative License
The 1937 movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is mostly remembered for being both the first animated feature and the birth of Walt Disney as an entertainment powerhouse. Lost in the shuffle was the film’s foreshadowing of Hollywood’s savvy approach to merchandising tie-ins. A coordinated push was timed to the release for a series of Snow-centric goods like hats (modeled by a young Lucille Ball), bath powders, and even a soundtrack. If you get a kick out of your Darth Vader coin bank, you have Sneezy, Grumpy and the rest to thank for it.
7. Seeing More in The Robe
Movie theater attendance declined sharply beginning in the 1950s. Taking a bite out of the box office was the advent of television , which had grown from being virtually non-existent during the late 1940s to being in 33 percent of homes by 1952.
In order to maintain their business, Hollywood decided to expand horizontally. Though widescreen—a filmed image appearing approximately twice as wide as it is tall in various aspect ratios—had been invented decades prior, it wasn’t until 1953’s biblical epic The Robe was released that filmgoers noticed how a screen that filled their peripheral vision could be more immersive.
Fox marketed it as CinemaScope; unlike earlier, more expensive attempts, only an anamorphic lens was needed to film the effect. Viewers reacted positively and widescreen is now the industry standard. (Fox wasn’t so confident, though: They also filmed the movie in a standard ratio, just in case.)
8. Indiana Jones and the Target Demographic
When Jack Valenti took over the Motion Picture Association of America in 1968, he recognized an emerging maturity in film, with sex, language, and violence no longer prohibited by the puritanical Hays Code created in the 1930s. By 1984, the MPAA’s system had morphed to include G, PG, R, and X—a spectrum that deemed movies suitable for children, general audiences or people in trenchcoats.
There was a considerable gulf, however, between the innocuous PG (Parental Guidance) label and the violence and sexual content of an R film. That middle ground was on gory display in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg’s sequel to his blockbuster Raiders of the Lost Ark. In Temple, Harrison Ford contends with monkey brain appetizers, whipped children, and a voodoo priest ripping the still-beating heart from a hapless human sacrifice. It received a PG rating. So did that year’s Footloose. Something was very wrong.
Spielberg suggested to Valenti that a new advisory be created to bridge the gap between family fare and ultraviolence. The result was PG-13, which gave parents a clue to reconsider how appropriate a movie may be for their teenagers. It was too late for Jones, though: 1984’s Russian invasion flick Red Dawn became the first movie to sport the rating.

‘Assassin’s Creed’ Starring Michael Fassbender Will Be Unleashed Summer 2015
Posted on Friday, May 17th, 2013 by Germain Lussier
Briefly: There’s been a killer addition to the Summer of 2015. Assassin’s Creed, based on the popular Ubisoft video game series, will hit theaters on May 22, 2015. 20th Century Fox is now on board the project which, at this point, only has Michael Fassbender attached to play  Desmond Miles, the descendant of a long line of assassins who can relive the memories of his ancestors.
At this point, no other film is schedule on that date but, if Star Wars Episode VII comes out on its traditional Summer weekend, it’ll be going up against this film.
Michael Lesslie is writing the screenplay . No director is attached but with a release date two years away from next weekend, you can expect that to change soon. [ Coming Soon ]
