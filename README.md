# NewsCat

A categorizer that uses a ground truth collection of articles about a
certain set of topics and then categorizes new articles based on a
trained model.

The following categories will be considered:
 
- Politics
- Business
- Technology
- Sports
- Science
- Entertainment

To make things quick, we'll just grab some articles from subreddits of
the same name and train a model based on that.
